This comprehensive article provides an in-depth overview of the patent registration process in India, covering essential aspects such as criteria for patentability, different types of patents, required documents, office jurisdictions, online registration procedures, fees, validity periods, handling objections, revocation, patent assignment, the appeals process, and international patent registration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In India, the registration and enforcement of patents are governed by the Patent Act, 1970, and its corresponding rules, the Patent Rules, 2003. As the tech industry continues to witness rapid advancements, numerous innovative technologies become eligible for patent protection, granting inventors exclusive rights over their inventions for a period of 20 years. Moreover, India is a signatory to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, enabling inventors to seek international patent protection across multiple countries simultaneously.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Understanding the intricacies of the patent registration process is crucial for applicants. This article delves into the step-by-step procedure of filing a patent application, along with the necessary documentation. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the patent registration process, inventors and businesses can effectively protect their intellectual property, capitalize on their innovations, and leverage the multitude of benefits associated with patent rights</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>WHAT IS A PATENT?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A patent is an exclusive right granted to any invention, whether it's a process or a product, under the provisions of the Patents Act. According to the Patents Act, an invention is defined as a new product or process that involves an inventive step and is capable of industrial application. This definition highlights three crucial components, also known as the patentability requirements:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"lower-roman\"} -->\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Novelty:</strong> The invention must be new and not disclosed to the public in any way before the filing date of the patent application. It should be a fresh and original concept that has not been previously known or made available to others.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Inventive Step:</strong> The product or process to be patented should involve an inventive step. This means that the invention should demonstrate a technical advancement over existing knowledge and should not be obvious to someone with the same skill set. It should possess an element of creativity and uniqueness.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Industrial Application:</strong> The invention should be capable of industrial application, meaning it should be useful and applicable in a particular industry or across various industries. It should have practical utility and be feasible to produce or use.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Only when an invention satisfies these patentability requirements does it become eligible for protection under the Patents Act of 1970. By meeting these criteria, inventors can secure the exclusive rights to their inventions, safeguard their intellectual property, and have the opportunity to capitalize on their innovative creations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>However, there are certain kinds of inventions that cannot be patented as per the Patent Act, 1970. These include:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Inventions contrary to natural laws.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Inventions those are prejudicial to human, animal, plant life, health, or the environment.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Mere discoveries of scientific principles or formulation of abstract theories.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Discoveries of living or non-living substances occurring in nature.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Mere inventions of known process or machines unless they result in a new product.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Mere admixtures resulting in the collection of properties of components.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Mere arrangements or rearrangements of devices commonly found in nature.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Inventions excluded by the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2002.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Methods used for agriculture or horticulture purposes.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Processes related to medicinal, surgical, curative, prophylactic, diagnostic, therapeutic treatment for humans.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Processes related to animal treatments for disease prevention.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Inventions concerning plants and animals, including seeds, varieties, species, and essentially biological processes for their production, excluding microorganisms.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Computer programs or mathematical methods.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Creations related to literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic works, including cinematographic works and television productions.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Mere methods of playing a game.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Mere information presentation.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Topography of integrated circuits.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Inventions that aggregate or duplicate known properties of components traditionally known.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Inventions related to atomic energy, for which no patent shall be granted.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's important for inventors to understand these exclusions when considering patentability and seeking protection for their inventions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>TYPES OF PATENTS:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are different types of patents that can be obtained based on the nature of the invention:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"lower-roman\"} -->\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Utility Patents:</strong> Utility patents are the most common type of patents granted for new and useful processes, machines, compositions of matter, or any useful improvements thereof. These patents provide exclusive rights to inventors for their inventions that have a practical application. Utility patents typically cover a wide range of fields, including technology, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Illustration:</strong>&nbsp;A utility patent may be granted for inventions such as a novel manufacturing process, a new electronic device, or a pharmaceutical composition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"lower-roman\"} -->\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Design Patents:</strong> Design patents protect the ornamental appearance or visual characteristics of an object rather than its functionality. They are granted for new, original, and ornamental designs applied to an article of manufacture. Design patents focus on the aesthetic elements of an invention and are often sought for consumer products and industrial designs.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Illustration:</strong>&nbsp;A design patent may be granted for the unique shape of a smartphone, the pattern of a fabric, or the design of a furniture piece.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"lower-roman\"} -->\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Plant Patents:</strong> Plant patents are granted for new and distinct varieties of plants that are asexually reproduced. This type of patent protects the invention of new plant species, excluding microorganisms. To be eligible for a plant patent, the plant variety must be novel, non-obvious, and reproducible through asexual reproduction methods such as grafting or cutting.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Illustration:</strong>&nbsp;A plant patent may be granted for a newly cultivated hybrid orchid or a unique strain of genetically modified corn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>DIFFERENT TYPES OF PATENT REGISTRATION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"lower-roman\"} -->\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Complete Patent:</strong> A complete patent application is a comprehensive filing that includes a detailed specification, claims, drawings (if necessary), and other supporting documents. It provides full legal protection for the invention and is suitable when the invention is ready for commercialization or public disclosure. The complete patent application undergoes a thorough examination by the patent office to assess its patentability and determine whether the invention meets the criteria for granting a patent.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Illustration:</strong>&nbsp;When an inventor has fully developed their invention and wants to secure exclusive rights, they can file a complete patent application.

It allows inventors to secure a priority date and use the phrase \"Patent Pending.\" The provisional patent application is less formal and does not require the same level of detail as a complete patent application. It provides inventors with a one-year period to further develop the invention, assess its market potential, and decide whether to proceed with a complete patent application.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Illustration:&nbsp;</strong>Inventors who have an invention in the early stages of development or are not yet ready to disclose all the details of their invention may opt for a provisional patent application. This provides them with an initial level of protection and allows them to refine their invention, conduct market research, or seek potential investors without losing their priority filing date.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's important to note that while a provisional patent application offers some initial protection, inventors must file a complete patent application within one year to fully protect their invention. The complete application will incorporate the details from the provisional application and undergo a comprehensive examination process by the patent office.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>WHAT DOCUMENTS ARE REQUIRED FOR PATENT REGISTRATION?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To register a patent, you need to submit various forms and documents.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\n\t\n<p>In today's highly competitive business landscape, start-ups in India face numerous challenges in establishing their presence and gaining a competitive advantage. To safeguard their innovative ideas and inventions, patent registration plays a vital role. Registering a patent provides exclusive rights to the inventor, preventing others from copying or reverse-engineering their products or inventions. This article explores the significance of patent registration in India for start-ups and the wide range of benefits it brings to their growth and success.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A patent is a legal right granted by the government that gives the inventor exclusive rights over their invention. It provides the inventor with the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the patented invention without their permission. Patents are typically granted for inventions that are new, non-obvious, and have industrial applicability.</p>\n<p><strong>The Importance of patent registration for start-ups in India can be understood through the following benefits:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Protection from Copying or Reverse Engineering:</strong> Patent registration offers start-ups robust protection against competitors who may attempt to copy or reverse-engineer their products or inventions. By securing a patent, start-ups can gain legal backing and exclusive rights, thereby enjoying a significant competitive edge in the market. With this protection, start-ups can safeguard their unique innovations and prevent unauthorized use by others, preserving their market share and revenue potential.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Company Valuation:</strong> Registering a patent enhances the market value and credibility of a start-up. Investors are naturally attracted to start-ups that possess patented technologies or innovative solutions. Patent registration serves as tangible proof of a start-up's commitment to innovation and its potential for growth, thus positively impacting its company valuation. It demonstrates the start-up's unique selling proposition, making it easier to attract funding, partnerships, and investment opportunities.</li>\n<li><strong>Brand Value and Recognition:</strong> Patent registration contributes to the overall brand value and recognition of a start-up. It showcases the start-up's dedication to research and development, innovation, and market differentiation. Possessing a patented invention creates a favorable reputation in the market, positioning the start-up as a leader and innovator in its industry. This recognition can help attract customers, forge strategic partnerships, and foster potential collaborations, further enhancing the start-up's growth prospects.</li>\n<li><strong>Facilitates Mergers &amp; Acquisitions:</strong> Patent registration strengthens a start-up's position in mergers and acquisitions. A registered patent serves as a valuable asset that can significantly enhance the start-up's negotiating power. It substantiates the start-up's ownership of unique technologies or inventions, making it an appealing acquisition target for larger companies seeking to expand their intellectual property portfolio. Patent registration can open doors to lucrative acquisition opportunities and provide a pathway for accelerated growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Keeps Competitors at Bay:</strong> A patent grants start-ups a formidable competitive advantage by creating barriers to entry for competitors. It prevents others from developing similar products or inventions, thus protecting the start-up's profitability and market share. Patent registration empowers start-ups to stay ahead of the competition, maintain their unique selling proposition, and capitalize on their innovations without the threat of direct competition. This exclusivity allows start-ups to establish themselves as industry leaders and secure their position in the market.</li>\n<li><strong>Licensing and Monetization Opportunities: </strong>Patent registration enables start-ups to license their patented technologies or inventions to other companies. By licensing their intellectual property, start-ups can generate additional revenue streams and establish strategic partnerships. Licensing agreements can provide access to new markets, expertise, and distribution channels, amplifying the start-up's market reach and profitability.</li>\n<li><strong>Funding and Investor Attraction:</strong> Having a registered patent significantly increases the appeal of a start-up to potential investors. It demonstrates the start-up's commitment to innovation, its ability to protect its intellectual property, and its long-term growth potential. Investors are more inclined to invest in start-ups with patented technologies, as it mitigates the risk of intellectual property theft and strengthens the start-up's competitive position. Patent registration can be a powerful catalyst for attracting funding, accelerating growth, and securing the resources needed to bring innovative ideas to market.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic Business Expansion: </strong>Patent registration empowers start-ups to expand their business operations strategically. With exclusive rights over their inventions, start-ups can enter new markets and explore partnerships with domestic and international companies. Patents open doors to collaborations, joint ventures, and technology transfers, facilitating business expansion and creating opportunities for revenue growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Research and Development Incentives: </strong>Patent registration fosters a culture of innovation and incentivizes start-ups to invest in research and development (R&amp;D). Knowing that their inventions will be protected, start-ups are encouraged to continue developing new and improved products or technologies. This focus on R&amp;D drives technological advancements, contributes to industry growth, and positions start-ups as pioneers in their respective fields.</li>\n<li><strong>Government Support and Recognition:</strong> The Indian government recognizes the importance of patents in promoting innovation and supporting start-ups. To boost start-up confidence and protect their innovative ideas, the government has introduced initiatives under the Start-Up India Action Plan. These initiatives provide various forms of support, funding, and incentives for start-ups to register their patents. By filing for patent registration, start-ups align themselves with these government initiatives, increasing their chances of receiving assistance, grants, and recognition. Here are some specific facilitations provided under the <strong>Startup India Scheme</strong>:</li>\n<li><strong>Special Rebate in Patent Costs:</strong> Start-ups registered under the Start-Up India Scheme are eligible for a special rebate in patent costs. They can avail an 80% rebate on patent filing fees, making the process more affordable and accessible. This cost reduction significantly lowers the financial burden on start-ups during the patent registration process, encouraging them to protect their intellectual property.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Patent Registration Process:</strong> Start-up companies also enjoy expedited processing of their patent applications. The government has introduced relaxed criteria for availing expedited examination, allowing start-ups to receive faster approval for their patents. This streamlined process helps start-ups secure their intellectual property rights more quickly, enabling them to leverage their inventions in the market without unnecessary delays.</li>\n<li><strong>Assistance in Patent Filing and Advisory Services:</strong> The Start-Up India Scheme provides start-ups with comprehensive support in patent filing and advisory services. Dedicated agencies and organizations are appointed to assist start-ups throughout the patent registration process. These agencies offer guidance, expertise, and resources to help start-ups navigate the complex procedures, ensuring their patent applications are filed correctly and efficiently.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Fees for Patent Examination and Prosecution:</strong> Start-ups registered under the Start-Up India Scheme receive reduced fees for patent examination and prosecution. This reduction in fees helps alleviate the financial burden on start-ups, making the overall patent registration process more cost-effective. It encourages start-ups to seek legal protection for their inventions, fostering a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The initiatives under the Start-Up India Scheme demonstrate the government's commitment to supporting start-ups in their patent registration journey. By providing financial incentives, faster processing, and advisory services, the government aims to create a conducive environment for start-ups to protect their intellectual property and drive innovation. Start-ups that take advantage of these government facilitations can enhance their competitive advantage, attract investors, and fuel their growth in the market.</p>\n<p><strong>While the benefits of patent registration are substantial, it is important to acknowledge a few challenges:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Public Availability of Information:</strong> The patent application process requires disclosing technical information about the invention, which subsequently becomes publicly available. Start-ups should carefully consider the trade-off between patent protection and preserving certain details of their invention as trade secrets.</li>\n<li><strong>Time-consuming Process:</strong> The patent application and granting process can be lengthy and time-consuming. Obtaining a granted patent may take several years, during which the market landscape may evolve, and newer technologies may emerge. Start-ups need to manage this timeline effectively to align their patent protection strategy with their business goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Financial Considerations: </strong>Patent registration involves various costs, including application fees, search fees, and attorney fees. Start-ups should meticulously evaluate the financial implications and weigh them against the potential long-term benefits and market advantages that come with patent protection.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\n<p>Patent registration in India holds immense importance for start-ups. It provides legal protection, enhances company valuation, and fosters innovation. Registering a patent grants exclusive rights, strengthens the start-up's position in the market, attracts investors, and opens doors to licensing and strategic partnerships. With the support of the Indian government and the numerous benefits associated with patent registration, start-ups can navigate the competitive landscape, drive growth, and contribute to the overall development of the nation's entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer: The information provided in this blog post is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered as legal advice.

Competitors can take advantage of your innovative ideas without facing legal consequences, undermining your competitive position.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Limited Market Potential:&nbsp;</strong>The absence of patent protection makes it challenging to secure partnerships or distribution agreements.

This can establish exclusivity over related inventions, blocking your future business opportunities and impeding your business growth. It may also limit your ability to license or sell your invention, causing you to miss out on valuable revenue streams.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let's consider the example of a software startup that develops a groundbreaking app for simplifying task management in businesses.

During this time, others are prohibited from making, using, or selling your patented invention without obtaining your permission.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To ensure that you maintain this protection for the entire 20-year duration, there are two important considerations:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"lower-roman\"} -->\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Timely Renewal:</strong>&nbsp;It is crucial to renew your patent in a timely manner by fulfilling the necessary requirements and paying the required fees to the patent office.

This involves understanding the specific requirements and processes involved in obtaining and enforcing patent rights in different countries.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Patent is crucial for protecting and benefiting businesses.

It's not a one-size-fits-all scenario; you need to tailor costs to your unique needs, considering factors like office space and visa numbers. For freelancers, your foundational investment falls in the range of AED 5,000-7,500, marking your entry into the business world. If you're a one-person operation, the typical cost is around AED 15,000, giving you the independence to conquer the business landscape on your terms. Ready to lead a team of four? The ballpark figure is approximately AED 62,000, offering the perks of dedicated space for your growing venture. But here's the catch—visa quotas in most free zones are tied to rented space, adding a strategic layer to your considerations.

In this guide, we're going to walk you through the intricacies outlined in these legal documents, offering a step-by-step walkthrough for both local and foreign entities. Whether you're a business owner or an individual, the information provided here equips you with the knowledge to efficiently navigate the UAE's trademark registration process, ensuring the safeguarding of your brand identity. So, let's dive in and explore the essentials of trademark registration in the UAE.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The basis of UAE trademark registration proceedings is the UAE Federal Law no. 36 of 2021 (the “<strong>Trademark Law</strong>”) and Executive Regulation (Cabinet Decision No. 57/2022) (the “<strong>Regulation</strong>”). The basis of trademark registration, opposition and rejection can be found in these legislations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong></strong><strong>Who Can Apply for a Trademark in the UAE?</strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>According to UAE laws, you – whether you're an individual, a company, a partnership, or any other legal entity<a href=\"#_ftn1\" id=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> – are eligible to register trademarks if you own or have the legal right to use them within the UAE.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>To get the ball rolling, as a business owner, you need to have a genuine presence in the UAE, either physically or through a legal representative.

These elements, however, must serve the fundamental purpose of distinguishing one brand from another. It's your unique stamp, your brand's identity. But, there are some ground rules. Your trademark can't play host to geographic names, symbols offending public morals or religions, public symbols like flags, or internationally recognized symbols like the Red Cross and Red Crescent. Names or titles of third parties or direct translations of other well-known trademarks are also off the trademarking table. Remember, while trademark registration is not mandatory here, it offers you exclusive rights and a shield against potential infringers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong></strong><strong>Trademark Validity in the UAE</strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you've successfully registered your trademark in the UAE, it's a decade of exclusive rights for you. That's right, a solid 10 years of brand protection. And what happens after this period? Well, renewal is the name of the game, and yes, it comes with its associated renewal fees.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong></strong><strong>Renewing Your Trademark Registration</strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here's where you need to be on your toes. You've got a three-month grace period to renew your trademark after it gracefully completes its 10-year run. But beware, delays come at a cost – AED 1,000 monthly fines will be knocking on your door.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong></strong><strong>Cancellation of Trademark Registration</strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, plans change, and so do trademarks.

When filing a notice of opposition, it's not just about stating your case; you need to back it up with a Power of Attorney. If you're based within the UAE, get it notarized. If you're beyond the UAE borders, go the extra mile – notarize and legalize it. The Power of Attorney can be in Arabic or bilingual (Arabic and English), ensuring a seamless process for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong></strong><strong>Filing by an Entity Relying on Unregistered Trademark</strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, let's say you're relying on an unregistered trademark.

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The increasing focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles across various sectors has permeated the hospitality industry, changing the landscape of traditional lodging and making way for the rise of conscious hotels. These establishments not only promote sustainable and ethical practices but also reap financial benefits, dispelling the myth that ethical responsibility and profitability can't coexist.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*1. The Environmental Aspect: A Green Hotel Movement*</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The environmental leg of ESG primarily emphasizes sustainable operations, resource management, and reduction of carbon footprints. Conscious hotels, like the 1 Hotel in Brooklyn, New York, showcase this principle flawlessly. The establishment boasts reclaimed wood, a 25-foot green wall, and a commitment to reducing water waste. They've also embraced energy-efficient technologies, reducing electricity consumption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Such initiatives don’t just appeal to environmentally conscious guests but also translate to cost savings. Energy-efficient appliances, water-saving technologies, and waste reduction strategies can significantly reduce operational expenses in the long run.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*2. The Social Aspect: Community and Inclusion*</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The hospitality industry thrives on diverse experiences, and conscious hotels recognize the importance of community and inclusiveness. This social aspect ensures that businesses act with an awareness of the societies they operate within, fostering goodwill and building strong, lasting relationships.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Six Senses group, for instance, has always prioritized community engagement. They've created organic gardens that not only supply fresh produce to their kitchens but also offer employment opportunities to locals. This strategy not only ensures that guests enjoy farm-fresh meals but also strengthens ties with the community and provides direct economic benefits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*3. The Governance Aspect: Ethical Operations*</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Good governance in the hospitality sector ensures that hotels operate transparently and ethically, considering the well-being of employees, stakeholders, and guests. The Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts, for example, have a robust Code of Ethics and Conduct, ensuring that all operations are in line with global standards of fairness and responsibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Conscious governance not only upholds the brand's reputation but can also lead to higher employee retention rates. Employees working in an environment that respects and values them are likely to be more satisfied, leading to decreased turnover and associated recruitment costs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*Financial Implications: The Profitability of Conscious Hotels*</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s a misconception that ESG initiatives are an added expenditure without direct financial returns. However, conscious hotels have debunked this myth time and again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Firstly, there's the matter of increased patronage. A 2020 survey by Booking.com revealed that over 70% of travelers believed companies should offer sustainable travel choices. As the number of eco-conscious travelers grows, hotels that actively engage in sustainable practices find themselves with a competitive edge, attracting a larger share of this burgeoning market.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Secondly, many sustainable practices lead to long-term cost savings. While the initial investment might be hefty, the ROI, in terms of reduced energy bills, water conservation, and waste management, is considerable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, there's a potential for increased brand loyalty. Guests who believe in a hotel's mission and practices are more likely to return, reducing the costs associated with customer acquisition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*Concluding *</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The hospitality industry, with its global reach and direct impact on local communities and environments, is uniquely positioned to drive meaningful change through ESG initiatives. As showcased by conscious hotels like 1 Hotel, Six Senses, and Fairmont, these principles not only align with the demands of modern consumers but also contribute positively to the bottom line.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The future of hospitality is undeniably green and conscious. Hotels that recognize this shift and integrate ESG principles into their core operations will not only pave the way for a more sustainable future but will also enjoy the lucrative benefits of being at the forefront of this transformation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The mining sector, historically characterised by its intensive resource extraction processes and substantial environmental footprints, is undergoing a transformation. This metamorphosis is driven largely by Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations. ESG has evolved from being a mere buzzword to becoming a crucial determinant in the future and viability of mining enterprises. The importance of integrating ESG into the mining sector cannot be overstated for several reasons.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*1. Environmental Stewardship:*&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mining, by it's very nature, can have profound environmental impacts. These range from deforestation and habitat destruction to water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The \"E\" in ESG encourages responsible resource extraction. It emphasizes the need for sustainable practices like water recycling, land reclamation, and the use of renewable energy sources in operations. By adhering to stringent environmental standards, mining companies not only reduce their ecological footprint but also ensure the longevity of their operations by conserving resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*2. Social License to Operate:*&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The social dimension of ESG underscores the relationship between mining companies and the communities in which they operate. Mining activities can displace local communities, alter their way of life, and sometimes even result in human rights violations. By prioritizing the \"S\" in ESG, mining firms can work collaboratively with local communities, ensuring their rights, traditions, and livelihoods are respected and preserved. This creates a social license to operate, where mining activities are not just legally permitted but also socially accepted and supported by local communities. In the absence of this license, mining companies can face severe reputational risks, operational delays, and escalating costs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*3. Governance and Ethical Practices:*&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Governance, the \"G\" in ESG, pertains to the way companies are run. For mining enterprises, this includes ensuring ethical practices, transparency in operations, and adherence to global standards. This can mean everything from ensuring there's no corruption or bribery in obtaining mining rights to being transparent about environmental impacts and remediation efforts. Strong governance practices result in trust, which is invaluable in terms of investor confidence and stakeholder support.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*4. Financial Resilience and Investor Appeal:*&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In today’s investment landscape, ESG-compliant companies are more appealing to investors. Many investment funds now consider ESG factors as a core part of their assessment criteria. A mining company that integrates ESG is seen as less risky because it is proactive in addressing potential environmental or social liabilities. This can translate to better access to capital, favourable loan terms, and a competitive edge in the global market.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*5. Future-Proofing Operations:*&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As global regulatory landscapes evolve, there is a rising emphasis on sustainability and responsible business practices. By integrating ESG, mining companies are essentially future-proofing their operations, preparing for a world where responsible mining isn’t just appreciated, but demanded. They are also better poised to adapt to changing regulations, avoiding penalties and operational disruptions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*6. Talent Attraction and Retention:*&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The modern workforce, especially millennials and Gen Z, prefer to work for organizations that align with their values. ESG-compliant mining companies are better positioned to attract and retain talent, a critical factor considering the specialized skills required in the mining sector.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*Conclusion:*&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The importance of ESG in the mining sector is multifaceted. It is not merely about adhering to global standards or meeting investor demands. At its core, ESG integration in mining is about reshaping the sector for the better, ensuring that resource extraction is balanced with environmental protection, social equity, and ethical governance. It's about ensuring that the resources we extract today don't come at the cost of tomorrow. For the mining sector, ESG isn't just a good-to-have; it's a must-have for sustainable, long-term success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The burgeoning discourse on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues has found an indelible place within the global business sphere. One industry where the significance of ESG is felt profoundly is the tea sector, more specifically the Indian tea gardens that significantly contribute to global tea production.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>India, the world's second-largest producer of tea, boasts expansive plantations that form an intrinsic part of the nation's socio-economic fabric. However, these verdant landscapes often mask a slew of ESG issues that have consequential implications for the industry's sustainable future.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the environmental front, tea gardens face considerable challenges. Tea cultivation is an environmentally intensive process, requiring substantial quantities of water and land. Practices like monoculture have led to soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and heightened vulnerability to pests and diseases, prompting excessive use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Additionally, climate change poses a grave threat to the productivity and quality of tea, necessitating climate-smart practices to mitigate its effects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The social issues plaguing the tea gardens are of equal concern. A considerable portion of India's tea garden workforce consists of women, often subjected to exploitative labor conditions, including low wages, inadequate living conditions, and lack of access to basic healthcare and education facilities. These conditions have ramifications for the overall wellbeing of the workers and their families, which, in turn, affects productivity levels.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Governance issues also exist, stemming from an often complex network of relationships among tea estate owners, workers, government bodies, and certification bodies. These complexities can sometimes result in poor oversight, lack of accountability, and instances of corruption, impacting the overall operational efficiency and sustainability of the tea gardens.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In light of these persistent challenges, the importance of ESG reporting for Indian tea gardens becomes abundantly clear. It brings transparency to the practices within these gardens, allowing stakeholders – including investors, consumers, and regulators – to make informed decisions. By assessing their ESG risks and impacts, tea gardens can also identify opportunities for improvement, fostering resilience and competitiveness in the long run.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Furthermore, ESG reporting provides a platform to communicate a tea garden's commitment to sustainable practices, instilling confidence in stakeholders and enhancing brand value. From an investor's perspective, robust ESG reporting is crucial for managing financial risks related to these factors. A growing number of investors are incorporating ESG considerations into their investment strategies, acknowledging that ESG risks can significantly affect a company's financial performance and long-term viability.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From the consumer's perspective, an increasing number of individuals prefer ethically sourced and sustainably produced goods.

Simultaneously, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) strategies with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) as the overarching theme have gained prominence. This article delves into the significance of Green IT initiatives in the context of BRSR with an ESG focus, illustrating how the Indian IT sector is spearheading sustainability efforts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Green IT: Redefining Technology's Environmental Impact</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Green IT, also known as Sustainable IT or Eco-friendly IT, is a concept that emphasizes adopting environmentally responsible practices within the IT sector. With rising concerns about climate change and resource depletion, Green IT initiatives aim to minimize the industry's carbon footprint, energy consumption, and e-waste generation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In India, the IT sector has been a major driver of economic growth, but it has also contributed to environmental challenges. However, this has changed in recent years, as companies recognize the potential of Green IT to mitigate ecological impacts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sustainable Data Centers and Energy Efficiency</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Data centers, the backbone of IT operations, are notorious for their substantial energy consumption. The Indian IT sector has made considerable strides in adopting energy-efficient technologies, such as virtualization and cloud computing, to optimize data center operations. These innovations have not only reduced carbon emissions but also lowered operational costs for businesses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Furthermore, some IT companies in India have invested in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power to meet their electricity demands sustainably. Such endeavors showcase a commitment to Environmental (E) objectives within the ESG framework.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>E-waste Management and Circular Economy</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As technology evolves rapidly, electronic waste (e-waste) has become a mounting concern. Indian IT companies have taken proactive measures to manage e-waste responsibly. They have established recycling and refurbishment centers to extract valuable resources from discarded devices while ensuring safe disposal of hazardous materials. This approach aligns with both the E and S (Social) aspects of ESG, promoting responsible consumption and protecting the health of communities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, some IT firms have embraced the circular economy model, designing products for easy repair, upgrade, and recycling. This reduces waste generation and enhances the longevity of IT equipment, contributing to Sustainable (S) goals within the ESG framework.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Leveraging Technology for Social Impact</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Indian IT sector has harnessed technology's power to drive positive social change. Numerous companies have initiated projects focused on education, healthcare, and rural development. These endeavors leverage IT solutions to bridge societal gaps, foster inclusivity, and empower underprivileged communities. As a result, the IT industry in India is actively fulfilling its Social (S) responsibilities under the ESG umbrella.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>BRSR Strategy and ESG Integration</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the context of ESG, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is a crucial tool that enables companies to communicate their sustainability efforts and ESG-related performance to stakeholders. It allows businesses to be transparent about their environmental initiatives, social welfare programs, and governance practices.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the Indian IT sector, BRSR has become a guiding framework to align Green IT initiatives with ESG principles. Through comprehensive reporting, companies demonstrate their commitment to environmental preservation, social responsibility, and ethical governance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Impact on Investors and Stakeholders</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Investors and stakeholders increasingly consider ESG factors when making decisions. Companies that demonstrate strong environmental and social stewardship, alongside robust corporate governance practices, tend to attract greater interest from socially responsible investors.

One such emerging strategy is the Balance, Robustness, Sustainability, and Responsiveness (BRSR) strategy. This 700-word article elucidates how the BRSR strategy, focused on ESG, is driving a paradigm shift in the IT sector.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>BRSR strategy rests on four pillars - Balance, Robustness, Sustainability, and Responsiveness. They form a new blueprint for organizations to align their business strategies with ESG norms, steering them towards a responsible and sustainable future.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Balance is about equal emphasis on all ESG principles, thereby preventing companies from prioritizing one over the other. For example, it's important for an IT company not just to focus on minimizing its carbon footprint (Environmental), but also to pay equal attention to creating inclusive workplaces (Social) and fostering ethical business practices (Governance).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Robustness is the ability to withstand the uncertainties and upheavals that ESG-related risks might bring. IT companies are now using sophisticated technologies to ensure robustness in their operations. They are utilizing AI and machine learning algorithms to predict and manage environmental and social risks, thereby strengthening their ESG strategy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sustainability is about future-proofing the business. In the context of the IT industry, sustainability is about reducing the environmental impact of data centers, promoting recycling and e-waste management, fostering innovation in renewable energy, and ensuring long-term supply chain resilience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Responsiveness refers to an organization's agility in responding to ESG-related changes and challenges. This could be regulatory changes, stakeholder expectations, or new technologies that promote sustainability. Responsiveness is about being proactive, rather than reactive, and setting the tone for ESG excellence in the IT sector.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These four pillars of the BRSR strategy have been creating a tectonic shift in the IT industry, making ESG integration not just a compliance activity, but a strategic one. Several IT companies have already started reaping the benefits of this strategy, including enhanced reputation, improved stakeholder relationships, and increased business resilience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Adopting the BRSR strategy, for instance, has allowed IT companies to balance the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of their data centers, reducing their environmental impact. Advanced energy management systems, energy-efficient servers, and virtualization technologies are now becoming commonplace in the IT industry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Robustness in the ESG context has been particularly significant for the IT industry. As data breaches and privacy concerns rise, robustness in governance practices is more critical than ever. Furthermore, robust disaster recovery and business continuity plans have become integral to ensuring that IT companies can withstand unforeseen environmental or social crises.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sustainability initiatives in the IT industry are manifold. IT companies have been at the forefront of the digitalization movement, helping other industries reduce their environmental impact. The IT industry itself is focusing on reducing e-waste, promoting remote working to reduce commuting-related emissions, and advancing renewable energy usage in data centers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The IT industry's responsiveness to ESG has been noteworthy too. We have seen IT companies quickly adapting to regulatory changes, demonstrating readiness to shift towards more sustainable practices. For instance, they have been rapid in adopting renewable energy sources, enhancing data security measures in response to new privacy laws, and creating inclusive workplaces in response to societal demands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, implementing a BRSR strategy with an ESG theme is not without its challenges. It requires a strong commitment from leadership, adequate resources, and a culture of sustainability and ethics. But the potential benefits - ranging from risk mitigation, operational efficiencies, stakeholder engagement to improved financial performance - are simply too significant to ignore.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In conclusion, the BRSR strategy is providing a new framework for the IT industry to integrate ESG principles into its core strategy. By adopting this strategy, the IT industry can lead the way in creating a sustainable and responsible digital future.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

Such Trade Secrets often distinguish one business from another and make it unique. To safeguard such information, the company implies Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA). A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a legally binding contract that establishes a confidential relationship between the parties signing it. &nbsp;The party or parties signing the agreement agree that sensitive information they may obtain will not be made available to any others. The non-disclosure agreement works on a very simple principle; it creates a legal obligation on the receiver of the information not to disclose it to anyone else outside the terms of the contract and is governed by the <strong>Indian Contract Act, 1872.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><u>IMPORTANCE OF NDA</u></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>It maintains the secrecy of the information shared between two or more parties and reduces the chances of important information going out of the organisation.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>It is an essential legal document that settles any conflict between the contracting parties in the future related to confidentiality.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>The nature of NDA is a legally binding contract. However, in various circumstances, such a contract is breached and the confidential information shared with the party is leaked and misused. The breach of the NDA vests in the party the right to take legal recourse against the defaulting party and sue them for damages.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>In the highly competitive field, there’s always a possibility that employees will quit to join any other entity or establish their own business. Every time an employee leaves, they take valuable knowledge such as customer lists, marketing tools, company procedures etc along with them. The NDA imposes a legal obligation on the employee to keep the company’s classified data secret and not misuse it for a specified length of time, which may extend even after they leave your company.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><u>USES OF NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT</u></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Non-disclosure agreements are extremely important for all types of business deals.&nbsp;Especially in the case of small businesses and start-ups, a lot of work is outsourced to freelancers or contractors. While seeking investments, the start-ups need to share their idea which are in a very primitive state to the investors. &nbsp;At that point in time, you don’t want the person or company to steal your product/idea or other information and sell it themselves. Therefore, in this scenario, an NDA signed by both parties will help in protecting the sensitive information of such businesses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While seeking investment, finding potential partners, hiring new employees, obtaining new clients etc, the transfer of information from the company to the potential individuals is required. The importance of an NDA is highlighted in such cases as it helps maintain trust and prevents leakage of any crucial information that can undermine the business's profitability. Crucial information that requires an NDA is secret recipes, proprietary formulas, manufacturing processes client or sales contacts lists, non-public accounting figures or any other such information that sets the company apart from the others.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In an employer-employee relationship, a non-disclosure agreement usually comes attached with a non-compete agreement, by virtue of which, the employee cannot disclose the information not only during the period of employment but also for a certain period after the termination of such employment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><u>TYPES OF NDA</u></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are three types of non-disclosure agreements:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:1\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Multilateral NDA -Multilateral NDA involves more than two parties, one of which discloses sensitive information.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>Introduction:<br>As a start-up embarking on an exciting entrepreneurial path, it is important to build a solid legal foundation to protect your interests and mitigate your risks. Getting the right agreements and contracts in place is critical to protecting intellectual property, setting clear expectations for stakeholders, and ensuring regulatory compliance. This blog post covers the key agreements and contracts every start-up should consider implementing.</p>\n<p>Co-Founder Agreement:<br>A co-founder agreement is an important document for start-ups with multiple founders. This agreement sets out the roles, responsibilities and distribution of funds among the co-founders. It clarifies ownership, decision-making processes, timelines for exercising capital, and dispute resolution mechanisms. A well-crafted co-founder agreement can help start-ups avoid potential conflicts and ensure smooth cooperation between co-founders.  </p>\n<p>Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA):<br>Start-ups often deal with proprietary information, trade secrets, and sensitive data. NDAs are important when sharing confidential information with employees, consultants, potential investors, or business partners. This legally binding agreement ensures that the recipient maintains confidentiality and will not disclose or misuse confidential information. An NDA protects a start-up's intellectual property and helps maintain a competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>Employee/Contractor Agreements:<br>Clear contracts are important when hiring employees or hiring contractors. Employee agreements define terms and conditions of employment such as roles, responsibilities, remuneration, benefits, confidentiality obligations, and intellectual property ownership. A contractor contract specifies the scope of work, deliverables, payment terms, and ownership of work deliverables. These contracts protect start-up rights and set expectations on both sides.</p>\n<p>Client/Service Agreements:<br>A well-crafted customer/service agreement is essential when offering products or services to customers. These agreements define the scope of work, deliverables to be performed, payment terms, deadlines, and limitations of liability. They help protect the interests of the start-up, ensure clear customer expectations, and mitigate potential disputes.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Property (IP) Assignment Agreement:<br>Protecting a start-up's intellectual property is paramount. An IP transfer agreement ensures that all IP developed by an employee or contractor during the contract is transferred to the start-up. The deal secures the start-up's ownership of innovations, inventions, designs, copyrights, trademarks and patents.</p>\n<p>Terms of Service/Use and Privacy Policy:<br>If your start-up operates an online platform, website, or mobile application, comprehensive terms of service and privacy policies are extremely important. These agreements set out the rules and guidelines for using the platform, protect start-ups from legal liability, and educate users on how their data is collected, used, and protected.  </p>\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\n<p>Getting the right agreements and contracts in place is critical for start-ups to protect profits, mitigate risk and ensure regulatory compliance. Co-Founder Agreement, Confidentiality Agreement, Employee/Contractor Agreement, Customer/Service Agreement, Intellectual Property Transfer Agreement, and Terms of Service/Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are important documents that every start-up should have. By investing time and resources in these legal documents, start-ups can establish a solid legal foundation, build stakeholder trust, and position themselves for long-term success. Keep in mind that it is important to obtain legal advice when drafting these agreements to ensure that your start-up's specific needs are met.</p>\n<!-- /wp:fl-builder/layout -->",

Start-ups focus on developing products and services, attracting customers, and driving growth. However, despite all the excitement, the importance of obtaining legal advice cannot be ignored. In this blog post, we explore why legal advice is essential for start-ups and how it can pave the way for long-term success.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Navigating Legal Complexities:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the main reasons start-ups need legal advice is to navigate the legal maze. From choosing the right corporate structure (sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC, etc.), to drafting contracts, protecting intellectual property, and complying with industry regulations, legal expertise is invaluable. By working with an experienced attorney, start-ups can ensure their business is legally sound and minimize the risk of costly litigation down the road.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mitigating Risks:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All start-ups face both internal and external risks that can significantly impact their survival and growth. Legal counsel plays an important role in identifying and mitigating these risks. They help us assess potential liability, draft comprehensive employment agreements, protect confidential information, and establish sound corporate governance practices. By proactively managing legal risks, start-ups can protect their interests and increase their chances of long-term sustainability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intellectual Property Protection:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For many startups, unique ideas, inventions and branding are key differentiators in the market.

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In today's digital era, where technology plays an integral role in our lives.<br>\nIn India, the importance of privacy policies and terms of use for websites and apps cannot be overemphasized. As the number of online businesses increases and the amount of personal data collected increases, it is more important than ever for companies to have clear and transparent policies. This article will delve into the significance of these legal documents, their impact on user trust, and their compliance with Indian regulations.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A privacy policy is a document that sets out how a website or app collects, uses, and shares personal information. Having a privacy policy is important for companies for the following reasons:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Identify the types of personal information collected</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Describe how your data will be used</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Provides information on how users can access and update their data.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Give users the right to opt out of data collection or sharing</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A Terms of Use Agreement is an agreement between a website or app and its user. It sets out the terms of use of the website or app, including what users can and cannot do. It is important for businesses to have terms of service in place for the following reasons:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Give users expectations</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Protect your company from legal liability</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Provide a way to resolve disputes between the Company and users</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Both your privacy policy and terms of use should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. It should also be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changes in business and legislation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Safeguarding User Privacy</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A privacy policy serves as a vital tool for protecting user privacy. It outlines the information collected, how it is used, and the measures taken to ensure its security. With the prevalence of cyber threats and data breaches, users are increasingly cautious about sharing personal information online. Having a clear and comprehensive privacy policy instils confidence in users, reassuring them that their data will be handled responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Building User Trust</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Implementing a transparent and well-defined privacy policy and terms of use helps build trust with users. When users visit a website or download an app, they want to know how their information will be used and shared. By explicitly stating the purpose of data collection, the methods employed, and any third-party involvement, businesses can establish trust with their user base. Trust is a vital aspect of user engagement and can greatly impact customer retention and loyalty.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Legal Compliance</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In India, websites and apps are subject to various laws and regulations concerning user data privacy. The Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011, under the Information Technology Act, 2000, lays down guidelines for the collection, storage, and usage of personal data. Adhering to these regulations is not only essential for legal compliance but also protects businesses from potential penalties and reputational damage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Avoiding Misuse and Liability</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By clearly defining terms of use, businesses can establish the rules and guidelines that users must follow while accessing their website or using their app. This helps prevent misuse, such as unauthorized access, copyright infringement, or any other prohibited activities. In case of non-compliance with the terms, businesses can enforce appropriate actions and disclaim liabilities for any damages caused by users' misuse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Resolving Disputes</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Terms of use provide a legal framework for resolving disputes between users and businesses. By clearly specifying the governing law, jurisdiction, and methods for dispute resolution (such as mediation or arbitration), businesses can streamline the resolution process and avoid costly litigation. This clarity ensures that both parties are aware of their rights and responsibilities, reducing the potential for conflicts and disputes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In an era marked by heightened concerns over data privacy, having a robust privacy policy and terms of use is crucial for websites and apps in India. These legal documents not only safeguard user privacy but also build trust, ensure legal compliance, mitigate liability, and facilitate dispute resolution. By prioritizing the implementation of comprehensive and transparent policies, businesses can not only enhance their reputation but also foster long-term relationships with their users. Remember, protecting user privacy is not just a legal obligation but also an ethical responsibility that contributes to a safer and more trustworthy online ecosystem.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are some additional tips for creating effective privacy policies and terms of use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Get legal advice</strong>.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\n\t<h2><strong>What Is New With The Online Gaming Intermediaries Regulations?</strong></h2>\n<p><strong><em>As the world becomes increasingly digital, the Indian government has introduced regulations to ensure the safety and security of its citizens online. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, were created to regulate intermediaries such as social media, messaging apps, OTT platforms, and online gaming platforms. Recognizing the growing popularity of online gaming and the potential risks involved, the government introduced the (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules, in April 2023 (\"IT Amendments Rules 2023\").</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>In this blog post, we will take a closer look at what these amendments mean for online gaming intermediaries and their users. Let's dive in and examine the changes!</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. IT Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021</strong></p>\n<p>The Indian government introduced the IT Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, which are aimed at regulating online intermediaries operating in India, including online gaming platforms. Essentially, online gaming intermediaries are websites and apps that allow people to play games, such as mobile games, online casino games, or fantasy sports. These regulations were created to ensure that online gaming platforms are responsible for the content they host and to safeguard users from illegal activities such as money laundering or fraud.</p>\n<p>In 2022, these rules were amended to provide additional protections for users and to hold online gaming platforms more accountable. For instance, online gaming intermediaries are now obligated to verify the identities of their users and report any suspicious activities to the authorities. Additionally, online gaming platforms must have measures in place to prevent the spread of sexually explicit content and offer voluntary user verification to ensure users are who they claim to be.</p>\n<p>In April 2023, the Indian government introduced amendments to the Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code that apply specifically to online gaming intermediaries. These changes include notification of removed content, a grievance mechanism for user complaints, blocking of illegal or violating content, a fact-check unit to identify fake news and self-regulatory organizations. While aimed at regulating online gaming and ensuring user safety, some critics have raised concerns about potential government overreach and the need for legal challenges.</p>\n<p>Let's delve deeper into the 2023 amendments and explore their implications in India.</p>\n<p><strong>2. IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules</strong>,<strong> 2023</strong></p>\n<p>The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has recently introduced amendments to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, in order to regulate online games and ensure the safety and security of users. The IT Amendments Rules 2023 contain several key points that are important to understand.</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li><strong>Definition of \"Online Game\"</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The IT Amendments Rules 2023 now include a definition of \"online game,\" which refers to any game accessible through a computer resource or an intermediary on the Internet.</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li><strong>Power to Notify Fact-Check Unit</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In 2023, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (\"<strong>MeitY</strong>\") was granted the power to notify a fact-check unit of the Central Government. This unit is responsible for identifying fake, false, or misleading online content related to any business of the Central Government [Rule 3(1)(b)(v)]. Intermediaries, such as social media platforms and messaging apps, are now required to make reasonable efforts to prevent their users from posting such information. The IT Amendment Rules, 2022, further amend these due diligence requirements for intermediaries. Rule 3(1)(b)(v) mandates that intermediaries must make reasonable efforts to ensure their users do not post any information related to any business of the Union Government that is identified as \"fake,\" \"false,\" or \"misleading\" by the FCU. It is important to note that the terms \"business\" of the Union Government and \"fake, false, or misleading\" remain undefined throughout the Rules.</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li><strong>Duty to Inform Users of Harmful Online Games</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If an online game can cause harm to the user, intermediaries and the grievance redressal mechanism have a duty to inform the user of its computer resource not to host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, store, update, or share any information related to that harmful online game.</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li><strong>Notification of Permissible Online Real Money Game</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If an online gaming intermediary has enabled users to access any permissible online real money game, it must inform its users of such change as soon as possible, but not later than 24 hours after the change is affected.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Due Diligence for Significant Social Media Intermediaries</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional due diligence must be observed by significant social media intermediaries under Rule 4, with sub-rules inserted that focus on any permissible online real money game. In such cases, online gaming intermediaries must display a demonstrable and visible mark of verification of such online game by an online gaming self-regulatory body on such permissible online real money game and not finance or enable financing to be offered by a third party.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Designation of Online Gaming Self-Regulatory Bodies</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rule 4-A has been inserted, allowing the Ministry to designate as many online gaming self-regulatory bodies as it deems necessary for verifying an online real-money game.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Applicability of Rules</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rule 4-B says that the obligations under Rule 3 and Rule 4 of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, will be applicable to online games only after the expiry of three months.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Central Government's Power to Direct Intermediaries</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rule 4-C states that if the Central Government considers the necessity in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, or friendship with foreign States, it can direct the intermediary to make necessary alterations without affecting the main point.</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li><strong>Self-Regulatory Organizations</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) will have to determine whether a gaming company's games entail wagering on any outcome and ensure that the assessment is based on existing jurisprudence as laid down by the Supreme Court of India on the determination of games of skill from games involving wagering and betting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Definitions of Online Real Money Gaming</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>New definitions of online real money gaming have been introduced based on stakeholder consultation, which provides much-needed clarity in the IT Amendment Rules and will help in ongoing GST litigations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diligence Requirement for Gaming Companies</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gaming companies must follow the diligence requirement of content not causing \"user harm,\" and the Ministry must provide further clarification to avoid potential ambiguity in its interpretation.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Fact Checking Provision in Amendment 2023</strong></p>\n<p>The IT Amendment Rules 2023 have introduced a Fact Checking Provision aimed at curbing the spread of fake news and misinformation on digital platforms. The provision requires digital platforms to implement a mechanism for fact-checking content, but concerns have been raised about its impact on free speech and constitutional validity.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the Fact Checking Provision</strong>?</p>\n<p>The Fact Checking Provision, introduced on 6th April 2023, requires digital platforms to implement a mechanism for fact-checking content and empowers the government to notify a fact-check unit to identify fake or misleading content related to Central Government business. Violation of this rule can lead to the loss of safe harbour immunity.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the implications of the Fact Checking Provision?</strong></p>\n<p>The provision will require digital platforms to invest in technology and resources for fact-checking, but it is expected to benefit society by curbing the spread of misinformation. Intermediaries who fail to comply with the due diligence requirements under the amendment risk losing their \"safe harbour\" protections under the IT Act, 2000. However, concerns have been raised about the implications for free speech, particularly in the context of dissent.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the challenges to the Fact Checking Provision?</strong></p>\n<p>Some digital platforms have challenged the provision in court, arguing that it could infringe upon the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under the Constitution. The vague definitions of \"fake,\" \"false,\" and \"misleading\" content create grounds for censorship and violate previous court rulings and the IT Act, 2000. The Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) has filed a petition challenging the provision's constitutional validity, and the Bombay High Court has directed MeitY to respond by April 19, 2023, and explain the rationale behind the amendments.</p>\n<p>The IT Amendments Rules 2023 have been introduced with the intention of regulating online gaming intermediaries and protecting users from harmful content. However, the broad scope of these rules has raised concerns among some critics about their potential to give the government excessive control over information and news for the public at large. With the power to designate online gaming self-regulatory bodies and direct intermediaries, there may be legal challenges to the IT Amendments Rules 2023 on the grounds that they exceed the Indian government's authority. It remains to be seen how effective these amendments will be in regulating online gaming and ensuring user safety, and how they will be interpreted and enforced in practice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Author: <em>Aqib Khan is a law graduate from Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University, As an aspiring Corporate Lawyer, he has a proven track record in managing General Commercial Contracts, Contract Lifecycle Management, and providing expert counsel on commercial and corporate matters.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p><strong>WHAT IS A TERM SHEET AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR A START-UP?</strong></p>\n<p>A term sheet is a document that outlines the details of an investment between a start-up and its investors, including the amount of money involved and the terms of the investment. Investors typically expect a share of the company's equity and involvement in future decisions in exchange for their capital. Term sheets are commonly used by start-ups in India and other countries to quickly and easily raise funds from a small group of investors, avoiding complicated negotiations with multiple financiers. While term sheets can be useful for fundraising, they also carry risks, and either party can choose to walk away if the terms are not agreeable.</p>\n<p>When negotiating a term sheet, it's important to ensure that the financial projections are realistic and that the investors are committed to the business's growth. It's also crucial to be clear about what is desired from the term sheet and what can be sacrificed to obtain it, and to avoid overcommitment.</p>\n<p><strong>The key elements of a term sheet includes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Valuation</li>\n<li>Option Pools</li>\n<li>Liquidation Preferences</li>\n<li>Board of Directors</li>\n<li>Investor Rights</li>\n<li>Ownership</li>\n<li>Percentage of Share</li>\n<li>Classes</li>\n<li>Participation</li>\n<li>Rights</li>\n<li>Dividends</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>WHAT DOES A TERM SHEET IS MEAN FOR START UP?<br></strong><strong><br></strong>A term sheet is a written agreement that details the specific terms and conditions of a possible investment or business deal. This document is commonly used in start-up ventures, as it establishes the conditions under which investors would be willing to provide financial resources or other support to a company. The terms outlined in a term sheet can differ considerably, but typically include information such as the amount of funding being requested, the length of the investment period (usually one to three years), and the proportion of ownership that the investor will hold in the company.</p>\n<p><em>Start-ups find a term sheet to be a crucial document that assists them in securing financial support from potential investors. This document sets out clear and specific terms and conditions from the outset, which enables start-ups to prevent any potential confusion or conflicts later on.</em></p>\n<p><strong>WHEN CAN A COMPANY REQUEST FOR A TERM SHEET FROM INVESTORS?</strong></p>\n<p>The term sheet is a written agreement that outlines the conditions of a possible investment, such as the investment amount, contractual particulars, and other terms. Usually, businesses will ask for a term sheet from investors when they are in the final stages of raising funds and wish to finalize the terms before obtaining additional commitments from investors.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS TO KNOW WHEN YOU ARE GOING THROUGH VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING</strong>?</p>\n<p>Although the details of every deal may differ, a majority of term sheets consist of several significant provisions, which include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The investment amount that the start-up will receive.</li>\n<li>The investment terms, like the duration of the investment and the type of shares that are being offered.</li>\n<li>The conditions under which the investor can sell their shares in the company (if they want to do so).</li>\n<li>The deadline for both parties to accept the terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IS IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SECURE EQUITY FINANCING FROM A VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM WITHOUT A TERM SHEET?</strong></p>\n<p>If you're seeking financial support to take your start-up to the next level, you might be contemplating whether a term sheet is essential. A term sheet is essentially a legal agreement between two parties, i.e., the start-up and the venture capital firm. The primary purpose of a term sheet is to ensure that both parties are comfortable with the agreement's terms and that there are no surprises in the future. The risk profile is a significant component of a term sheet, and the venture capital firm will want to know how much risk the start-up is willing to bear. In return, the start-up may desire access to the venture capital firm's resources.</p>\n<p>However, if you're considering forgoing a term sheet, there are some crucial factors to bear in mind. Firstly, it may be challenging to obtain an equitable deal. Secondly, lacking a term sheet may reduce your bargaining power when negotiating terms with potential investors. Lastly, you may be relinquishing essential intellectual property rights in exchange for funding from a venture capital firm. If you're prepared to make this trade-off, make sure you fully comprehend the rights you're giving up before signing any agreements.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT FACTORS INFLUENCE AN INVESTOR'S DECISION REGARDING THE TERMS&nbsp;&nbsp; AND CONDITIONS THEY OFFER?</strong></p>\n<p>When assessing a start-up, the terms and conditions document is one of the first things investors will scrutinize. This document details what the start-up is offering investors and the corresponding rights and obligations. Start-ups may offer different terms to different investors, depending on their preferences and stage of investment.</p>\n<p>When drafting terms and conditions, several factors must be taken into account. These include the investment's duration, the investor's percentage ownership in the company after investing, and the type of shares that will be issued.</p>\n<p>Term sheets are crucial for start-ups in India since they aid in obtaining investment from investors. Start-ups require a term sheet to formally announce their plans to investors and attract capital. It also safeguards the interests of both the start-up and the investor. Both the start-up and the investor usually sign term sheets before exchanging funds. The document specifies how the funds will be paid out to the start-up and outlines the rights and obligations of each party.</p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure that both parties are satisfied with the final agreement, it is important to carefully evaluate and negotiate the term sheet during the initial stages of negotiation. Depending on the type of negotiations, the term sheet can also help build a stronger relationship between the parties.</p>\n<p>Investors will likely want to understand the level of control they will have over the business and how they will receive returns on their investment before making any final decisions. They may also be interested in reviewing the start-up's business plans, competition, team, experience, and products/services. Therefore, it's important to present a clear representation to the investor while balancing the objectives of maintaining maximum control and minimizing risks.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vidma Consulting Group</em></strong><em> is capable of providing you with any advice related to term sheets, along with helping you go through the negotiations and reach a valuable investment.

Therefore, a strong ESG proposition can create value for it. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company’s behaviour used by socially conscious investors to screen potential investments. Applying this approach leads to conscious decision-making that takes care of both, the business as well as the society and the environment.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><u>WHY IS ESG IMPORTANT FOR BUSINESSES&nbsp;</u></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s appropriate to establish that today’s market and economy run on a capitalistic approach and the end goal of every business is to maximise its earnings and profits. Such an approach often comes at the cost of harm to the environment and disregards the social responsibilities that the entity owes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What earlier used to be a vague topic of discussion has now become an investing priority keeping in mind the environmental sensitivity of these times.&nbsp;But implementing policies that take care of the environment and society has proved to be very beneficial for businesses in the longer run.&nbsp;&nbsp;What often comes as a result of not adhering to the ESG guidelines is physical hazards such as the damage that natural disasters do to the infrastructure and property as well as creating financial risks by way of losses and liabilities. Due to the disregard for social and environmental laws, the business could also face negligence claims against them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another very important aspect for a business to be successful is to earn the trust of its customers. Even the customers have become very socially aware and sensitive now and want to ensure that they are buying or rendering services that are ecologically and socially beneficial.&nbsp;&nbsp;By following proper ESG policies, the companies also gain their customers’ trust and build an image for themselves in their eyes making it crucial to integrate ESG into the corporate structure of the business.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the rising significance of ESG in India, investors will not just get a better yield over the long run, yet there will likewise be an immensely positive effect on the climate. This creates an environment where all the parties involved can thrive. Issues of extreme environmental damage leading to bigger devastating events can be prevented, which can help in bringing down natural and social dangers that might follow. There will likewise be a rise in ¸, which incorporates monetary services that coordinate ESG basis into their business and operations, which benefits both, the investors and the climate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Better performance in ESG also corresponds with a reduction in downside risk, as evidenced, among other ways, by lower loan and credit default swap spreads and higher credit ratings.&nbsp;<a href=\"applewebdata://7EE7CDAB-F9D4-40E1-8C4E-86FCD7CE9A59#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><u>THE IMPLEMENTATION AND REGULATIONS REGARDING ESG IN INDIA&nbsp;</u></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The implementation of ESG guidelines is still very new in India. Even though the investors and companies have started acknowledging its need, there is still a lack of implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To formulate all this in a codified manner, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs announced the Voluntary Guidelines&nbsp;on Corporate Social Responsibility which became the \"National Voluntary Guidelines\" (NVG) on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in 2011. The guidelines consisted of a total of 9 principles that discussed the Long-Term Sustainable Value of the Indian companies. Using these guidelines, the company can predict the several environmental and social risks that it might face in the future. Such information is then shared with the investors so that the investment decisions are made keeping in mind such risks and also helps them focus on finding ways to mitigate them. The guidelines being a voluntary approach, lack adequate adherence to them. In order to tackle this, SEBI in 2012 transformed this voluntariness into a compulsory mandate. It demanded for the top 100 listed businesses based on market capitalization to release a Business Responsibility Report. The threshold eventually included the top 500 companies to ensure maximum compliance with the scheme. To make the system more transparent, an integrated reporting mechanism was established by SEBI that provided all the necessary information to the stakeholders regarding the company’s strategy, governance and performance.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another approach that was implemented was the requirement to issue Green Debt Securities under Section 11(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. Green debt securities, commonly referred to as green bonds, are debt instruments intended to finance environmentally friendly projects in areas such as renewable and sustainable energy, low carbon transport modes, sustainable land use, water and waste management, climate change adaptation, energy efficiency, biodiversity conservation, etc. The purpose of this policy is dual-faceted as-</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Firstly, Green bonds are a good approach for an issuer to prove that it is environmentally conscious, which can assist to improve the issuer's reputation. It demonstrates the issuer's dedication to the advancement and viability of the environment.</li><li>Secondly, A dedicated worldwide pool of funds has been set out specifically for investments in green ventures. The primary focus of such funding are the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) components of the projects. Therefore, green bonds give an issuer access to these investors that they might not have access to otherwise.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, the SEBI planned to replace the BRR in 2020 with the \"Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report,\"&nbsp;<a href=\"applewebdata://7EE7CDAB-F9D4-40E1-8C4E-86FCD7CE9A59#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>which aims to persuade businesses to provide information on not just their financial compliance, but also the social and environmental effects of their operations. The requirement was that the top 1000 corporations by revenue would voluntarily use a redesigned reporting format for the financial year 2020-21. After this, compliance is made mandatory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The change in the applicability of such policies from a voluntary requirement to a mandatory one demonstrates that the narrative of ESG in India is being strengthened. An increase has also been seen in the focus on environmental issues in the company reports. The actual numbers showed that 87% of the reporting provisions dealt with environmental issues, while 35% dealt with social issues and 32% with governance issues. Key management of pollution, water, garbage, and other vital resources along with business operations were among the topics covered.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><u>GENERAL ISSUES FACED DURING ESG IMPLEMENTATION&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just as ESG is an inseparable part of how a business is done, its individual elements are intertwined. For example, the environmental criteria overlaps with the governance of a company when the business is trying to bring into the market a newer product which would increase the firm’s profit margins but uses a lot of resources in its manufacturing. This associativity often leads to a few challenges in the implementation of ESG policies.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;The Rapid policy changes in a short period of time have been effective but have also created some unpredictability, which has resulted in subpar and unclear communication reporting from businesses. Additionally, some businesses have&nbsp;begun to abuse sustainability reporting as a means to raise public awareness, which brings up the problem of Green Washing. It was noticed that companies were often seen conveying a false impression or providing misleading information about how their products are more environmentally sound. This was done to improve their public image and attract more customers as a result of which their profits would also increase. The main problem that has been picked up is the genuine consciousness/goal of the companies in implementing this approach. If their applicability is fuelled by just an increase in their profits and not an actual concern towards the environment or the public, there would always be room for misuse of such structures which would lead to the formation of a grey area about their effectiveness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The environment also becomes a stakeholder in the operations of the company. According to the stakeholder theory of governance, the company owes a fiduciary duty to all of its stakeholders as they all have an interest in the firm’s actions and decisions. Their interests are to be considered before conducting business operations due to the impact that it may have on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is noticed that the environment is often overlooked as an important stakeholder and its interests are neglected. This results in an Agency problem. Here, the environment is the principle that is affected majorly by the actions of its agent which is the business. When an agency problem occurs, the business prioritises its own interests and directs all its actions in its favour as a result of this, the interest of the environment is disregarded. In a situation where any conflict occurs between the owners of the business and all of its stakeholders, including its creditors, employees, and clients, the environment is also impacted by the actions of the company in that scenario. Here, the correct approach would be to make sure that the company does not act opportunistically towards the other stakeholders that might be directly involved or more impacted. Their decisions should not come at the cost of the interest of the environment. To avoid irreversible harm, businesses should respect the environment as a crucial stakeholder and preserving it should be a priority to ensure the company’s long-term sustainability and profits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><u>HOW ESG REGULATIONS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED BETTER IN INDIA&nbsp;</u></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>In India, a major problem is over-regulation. To do business a huge number of compliances and obligations need to be met. A way to motivate more companies to incorporate the ESG approach in their operations is through maintaining a record of all the companies that follow it, integrating them together and providing them with different prospectus requirements. Rather than creating new ESG regulations, which are the cause of over-regulation, they should be incorporated into the already existing laws. This would help to ensure that ESG companies do not need to undergo any unnecessary legal and compliance requirements. ESG companies indeed need to be put under a higher degree of scrutiny, but regulations need not be so diverse that it does not allow for any ESG firms to develop in the country. Incorporating it into the Companies Act, 2013, helps to ensure recognition of such companies while regulating them at the same time.&nbsp;</li><li>One more step that should be taken is the formation of an ESG panel. In India, it is notable that despite the regulations being great on paper, ill-advised execution is predominant in all fields. This can lead to more damage than anything else. Thus, to battle this, a particular ESG board of trustees should be made which will guarantee legitimate execution of future ESG regulations. Apart from this, the panellists should be allocated extra allowance to offer to the organizations to follow ESG guidelines as it likewise urges organizations to move from bio-hazardable resources to cleaner and green resources. This not just aids in the working of the economy, but also the climate.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><u>CONCLUSION&nbsp;</u></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We can see that ESG guidelines are significant for the overall benefit of any organization. Incorporating ESG practices is essential for a company to fulfil the interests of all its stakeholders.&nbsp;Although India does not have sufficient ESG-related legislation, the approach has been gaining importance and recognition by Indian investors and companies. SEBI and other entities have also directed their operations towards establishing an organised system that will determine the responsibility and accountability of the businesses in this regard. The incorporation of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report by SEBI has majorly strengthened the regulatory framework. In order to make the operations more robust, the regulations should be incorporated by all companies, irrespective of their size or market capitalisation. Awareness needs to be spread regarding the threats that a company's operations can have on the environment. This will motivate the companies to coordinate their activities in a way that they adhere to the ESG guidelines and aid in the holistic improvement of the environment as well as the long-term sustainability of the business</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Studying and analysing the approach of The European Union (EU) in this regard will also help India in the successful application of such guidelines as the EU was one of the first to recognise the importance of ESG and take steps to incorporate it into its legislation&nbsp;<a href=\"applewebdata://7EE7CDAB-F9D4-40E1-8C4E-86FCD7CE9A59#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>and create a difference in how the business operates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"applewebdata://7EE7CDAB-F9D4-40E1-8C4E-86FCD7CE9A59#_ftnref1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&nbsp;Umakanth Varrottil, Environmental and Social Reporting by Indian Companies (2019), https://archives.nseindia.com/research/content/QB_January_2019.pdf (last visited September, 2022).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"applewebdata://7EE7CDAB-F9D4-40E1-8C4E-86FCD7CE9A59#_ftnref2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&nbsp;SEBI | Integrated Reporting by Listed Entities, Sebi.gov.in (2017), https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/circulars/feb-2017/integrated-reporting-by-listed-entities_34136.html (last visited September, 2022).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"applewebdata://7EE7CDAB-F9D4-40E1-8C4E-86FCD7CE9A59#_ftnref3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> European Comission, Sustainable finance: Commission's Action Plan for a greener and cleaner economy (2018), https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_18_1404 (last visited September 2022)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>About the Author</strong>: Sonakshi Arora is a fourth year law student at Symbiosis Law School.

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nuclear fusion is what powers the stars. The concept of fusion being used as a viable source of energy, has been around since the 1920s. However, there were minimal chances of nuclear fusion materializing into a commercial source of energy. Come 2021, there has been a renewed interest in nuclear fusion in 2021, thanks to an array of technological advancements across the world. UK based JET has smashed its own record for the amount of energy it can extract. Once operational, the ITER is expected to make significant strides. <em>Tokamak Energy </em>has also announced that it has achieved what is by far the highest temperature achieved in a spherical Tokamak and by any privately funded Tokamak. MIT backed start up <em>Commonwealth Fusion Systems </em>announced in late 2021 that they have ramped up a large high temperature superconducting magnet to a field strength of 20 Tesla, a landmark in fusion research. UKAEA’s MAST-U (Mega-Amp Spherical Tokamak- Upgrade) has also shown promising results after being tested for one of the key challenges of fusion, which is minimizing exhaust heat from the hot gas of fusion fuels.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is rekindled hope in 2022 that nuclear fusion can be the ultimate source of clean, safe, disaster-resilient and cost-effective energy. With this, comes a number of challenges including political, regulatory and social challenges.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To address the challenges because of lack of a legal framework dedicated to fusion, the UK government released a fusion strategy in 2021. Non-nuclear regulation was proposed for nuclear fusion, as opposed to mature nuclear technologies. This is justified considering the fact that existing nuclear law regulations are mostly about the conventional uses of nuclear technology, which is nuclear fission. However, a dedicated regulatory framework for nuclear fusion is also necessary, considering the fact that there is no single way to achieve fusion. A one-size fits all approach when it comes to regulating nuclear fusion is impossible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Additionally, nuclear fusion faces quite some issues with public acceptance. Author of “The Star Builders”, Arthur Turrell, says that nuclear fusion has the lowest of public support globally, as compared to any other source of energy. An IPSOS poll conducted after the tragedy of Fukushima indicated that some countries are planning on phasing out fission power altogether. Fission admittedly has detriments- radioactive waste, chances of reactor meltdowns, restricted supply of fuel and the potential of proliferation of nuclear weapons. Fusion, mostly, does not. Tritium, a primary element used in the D-T reactor, is radioactive but with a short half-life. This makes it no-where nearly as dangerous as a conventional radioactive fuel. The chances of meltdown are nil and chances of proliferation, very limited. It is hence important that we give fusion a fair chance at commercialization which is possible only if there is substantial public acceptance. There are three aspects to this. <em>First, </em>there needs to be a strict delineation of nuclear fission and fusion. The general public are not always aware of the difference. This is a genuine handicap with countries with lower awareness on nuclear energy. <em>Second,</em> the term “nuclear” adds to the negative branding of fusion. The term “nuclear” is mostly associated with unfortunate incidents like <em>Three Mile Island </em>and<em> Chernobyl, </em>and this has only added to repulsion of nuclear power as a source of energy, in people’s perception. Public acceptance of any technology is crucial to its commercial success and an important aspect of effective policy-making. The word “nuclear” is also specifically muted from life-saving medical devices including nuclear magnetic resonance imaging devices.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In face of these, it is important that we understand that we understand the state of public acceptance of nuclear fusion. By public, we refer to rank and file customers, governments, NGOs including environmental groups and the public utility commission and it is only through fruitful coordination between these parties and general awareness that nuclear fusion can attain a commercially acceptable position.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>About the author</strong>- Anwita Mukherjee&nbsp;is an incoming MPP candidate at UChicago and an alumna of the esteemed Queen Mary University of London.

While there is no universal definition of CSR, it basically embodies the idea that corporations or companies must be responsible for their impacts on society and promote their development by integrating social, environmental, governmental and consumer concerns within their business. Section 135(2) mandates that a CSR board would also release a corresponding report outlining the company's CSR achievements and initiatives. Over time, CSR initiatives have more less been perceived as philanthropic as they focussed more on the social parameter of CSR.

The report notes that the pandemic of COVID-19 has also heightened the importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors for investors, resulting in increased investor awareness and a shift toward sustainable investing. The surge in new ESG-themed mutual fund launches and asset growth of such schemes, especially in India, reflects this new trend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Few of the key disclosures as given in the circular as follows-</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>An overview of the entity's material ESG risks and opportunities, approach to mitigate or adapt to the risks along-with financial implications of the same</li><li>Sustainability related goals &amp; targets and performance against the same</li><li>Environment related disclosures covering aspects such as resource usage (energy and water), air pollutant emissions, green-house (GHG) emissions, transitioning to circular economy, waste generated and waste management practices, bio-diversity etc</li><li>Social related disclosures covering the workforce, value chain, communities and consumers, as given below:</li><li>Employees / workers:&nbsp; Gender and social diversity including measures for differently abled employees and workers, turnover rates, median wages, welfare benefits to permanent and contractual employees / workers, occupational health and safety, trainings etc.</li><li>Communities:&nbsp; disclosures on Social Impact Assessments (SIA), Rehabilitation and Resettlement, Corporate Social Responsibility etc.</li><li>Consumers: <a>disclosures on product labelling, product recall, consumer complaints in respect of data privacy, cyber security</a> etc.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 id=\"industries-that-require-focus-on-esg-compliance\">INDUSTRIES THAT REQUIRE FOCUS ON ESG COMPLIANCE</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While ESG compliance and reporting is recommended for every company in every industry, there are certain sectors that have major ESG impacts, have low ESG ratings and thus need renewed efforts in this regard.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>CRISIL Ltd. released ESG scores for 225 Indian companies across 18 sectors in 2021.

They are also excellent job creators who have worked in their favour. Oil and gas, chemicals, metals and mining, and cement companies, on the other hand, received lower ESG scores, owing to their high natural-resource intensity, which translates to higher emissions, extractive use of natural resources, potential negative environmental and community impact, and generally more moderate levels of disclosure. As a result, these industries must redouble their efforts in ESG compliance and reporting.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">CONCLUSION</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thus, in this globalized world, it is more crucial than ever to ensure that ESG reporting is done diligently. Simply, putting off one fire after another as and when they come is a very unsustainable approach that negatively affects the company in the long run. Encouraging a culture of compliance is the way to go forward. Different jurisdictions have different compliance requirements. But there is a global call for standardized reporting guidelines for ease of business and understanding.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>About the author: This article is written by Ansruta Debnath, a legal intern at Vidma Consulting Group LLP.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<h1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n<p>We encounter many questions from new startups. One of the frequent questions we receive is, \"Is it legally required that my website have Terms and Conditions\"? \"If not, why do I need them?\"</p>\n<p>If you have recently started a new business or have immersed yourself in the startup world, you may be wondering if the website for your business requires legally binding documents.</p>\n<p>The answer to this question depends upon your business, type of services or goods, and products being offered.</p>\n<h1 id=\"are-terms-and-conditions-mandatory-by-law\">Are terms and conditions mandatory by law?</h1>\n<p>No, having a terms and conditions document on your website is not mandatory by law. However, you may be legally required to make certain disclosures if you provide certain services and goods, such as trading/ cryptocurrency platforms telehealth/ telemedicine platforms. Therefore, it is highly recommended to engage experts to write terms and conditions for your business. I will explain why in brief in this article.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-happens-if-you-do-not-have-terms-and-conditions\">What happens if you do not have terms and conditions?</h1>\n<p>Among many other implications, If a website does not have terms and conditions or other policies which dictate the terms of use of your website, services, or products, the applicable laws of the place in which a dispute arises will apply. For example, if your customer engages in a dispute in Colorado, USA, and your company is based in New York, the jurisdiction will automatically become the state of Colorado. You or a representative of your company will have to travel to Colorado to attend to the dispute. This kind of situation may be easily averted if a clause mentioning the \"governing laws\" is specified. We also recommend that alternative dispute resolution methods be adopted to resolve disputes faster.</p>\n<h1 id=\"services\">Services</h1>\n<h2 id=\"online-services\">Online Services</h2>\n<p>You may be providing services to your customers, such as online services like social media marketing, crowdfunding platforms, blockchain-based decentralized streaming platforms, telehealth/telemedicine platforms, and other similar online services. Suppose you provide any of the above listed or similar online services in which you provide services directly or indirectly through your website. In that case, it is highly recommended that you write terms and conditions for your website. A terms and conditions document legally bind your users to comply with the rules contained therein. This document will also have terms that will set out the rights and duties of your users and your company. The terms and condition document's most important features include limiting your company's liability and setting out terms for dispute resolution, including which country/state/province law will be applicable and the method of dispute resolution. In the case of online services, the terms and conditions document need to be relatively comprehensive compared to offline or physical on-site services (may vary depending upon business model).</p>\n<h2 id=\"offline-services\">Offline Services.</h2>\n<p>If you are running a business like a yoga studio, gym, hypnotherapy clinics, and provide other similar services which require either you, your employees, and your clients to be physically present at a premise to provide and avail services as applicable, and you are not providing such services through your website or other online mediums, a basic terms of use document dictating the use of your website may be enough. However, you may still require other documents to protect yourself, your employees, and your business, such as disclaimers, limitation of liability terms, etc. You may also need to make disclosures as may be mandated by laws.</p>\n<h2 id=\"goods\">Goods</h2>\n<p>Suppose you are selling goods through your website. In that case, it is essential to have terms and conditions written for your website as they will contain terms such as cancellation and refund terms, website usage policy, and other terms for effectively running your business. Terms regarding e-commerce websites vary depending upon your business model. If vendors can sign up and sell their products on your website (such as Amazon), or if only you are selling the products (Apple), the terms for your website will vary. A one size fits all approach will be detrimental to your business.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-else-do-you-need-for-your-website\">What else do you need for your website?</h1>\n<p>Even though having terms and conditions on your website is not mandated by law, it is mandatory to display your privacy practices on your website if you are collecting personal data from users via your website. Privacy practices of businesses are usually contained in a Privacy Policy document.</p>\n<p>Depending on where your business is based and in which countries users' data is being collected from and sent, you will need a privacy policy complying with such countries' local laws. For instance, If you are based in India, your business will require a Privacy Policy document containing the privacy practices of your business and website. Depending on the information collected, such document may also need to comply with the Information Technology Act 2000, Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Information) Rules, 2011, Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011, and other applicable laws mapped according to your business model.</p>\n<p>If you collect personal data from EU residents, you will need a General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) compliant Privacy Policy. If you collect personal data from the USA, such as California residents, your business will require a California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) compliant Privacy Policy. The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) (unofficially dubbed CCPA 2.0) amends the CCPA, which has been criticized for overbroad definitions and ambiguous language. The CPRA expands the privacy rights of California residents and increases compliance obligations for companies. The CPRA becomes effective on or after January 1, 2022 (other than for access requests) but will not be operative until January 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>Once again, companies will have to review their privacy programs and likely amend further to comply with CPRA's new requirements. That said, the CPRA generally becomes operative on January 1, 2023, and during that time, California regulators are expected to provide additional information on compliance and enforcement implications of the new law.</p>\n<p>Companies should monitor CCPA/CPRA developments and ensure their privacy programs and procedures remain aligned with current compliance requirements.</p>\n<p>The abovementioned legislation mandates that the privacy practices of businesses be transparent and declared to the general public. These privacy terms also contain the rights of your website users and where the users can reach your company to avail themselves of those rights.</p>\n<h1 id=\"how-we-can-help-you\">How we can help you</h1>\n<p>Mapping your product with the law and drafting documents for the safety of your business:</p>\n<p>We will assess your business model and accordingly determine the laws that apply to it.

In this post, the way to set up a business in India is discussed in detail for foreign companies and foreign nationals.</p>\n<p><strong>How the Foreign Companies Can Enter India for Business?</strong></p>\n<p>There are mainly two types of entry strategy for foreign businesses in India, registration of a company or establishing a branch/liaison office.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>By registering an entity like a private limited company, Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), or proprietary/ partnership firms.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Out of all the above forms of entities, the cheapest and the easiest way to set up business in India is by incorporating a private limited company, it will take 10-15 days for getting all the approvals and registration certificate.</p>\n<p>The foreign direct investment which ranges up to 100% in a private limited company or a limited company (LLP) happen under the automatic route and in such case, no special permission is required from the Central Government in India.</p>\n<p>100% FDI in LLP is also allowed now, but there are no shareholders in LLP but partners hence making it ideal for service or professional firms.</p>\n<p>While all other forms of entities require RBI approval, thus making it not much ideal for foreign investors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One can opt to register a branch office, project office, or liaison office which necessarily requires RBI and/or Government approval.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, if we consider the cost and the time which is required for the registration of a branch office, project office, or liaison office is undoubtedly higher than the time and cost attached to the incorporation of a private limited company in India.</p>\n<p><strong>What type of company can a foreign national or an NRI can incorporate in India?</strong></p>\n<p>A foreign national or a NRI can register a private limited company, public limited company or Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) in India.</p>\n<p>According to the FDI and FEMA regulations, in India the ideal type of business entity that the foreign nationals and the NRI can establish would be a private limited or public limited company as 100% FDI is allowed under the automatic route for most of the business sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the pre-requisites for incorporating a Private or Public Limited Company?</strong></p>\n<p>Director:</p>\n<p>To establish a company in India, there is a requirement of a minimum of two directors (persons) for a private limited company and a public limited company must have a minimum of three directors. Also, there should be at least one director who is both an Indian citizen and an Indian Resident (any person who has lived in India for over 186 days is considered an Indian Resident).</p>\n<p>Registered Office Address:</p>\n<p>Before starting the process of incorporation, the proposed company must have an office address in India. The registered office address proof, such as the sale deed or a rental agreement, must be submitted while filing the incorporation application. In case of a leased or rented property, the NOC (No Objection Certificate) from the owner of the rented or leased premises must be submitted for the use of the premises as a registered office.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the documents required for a Company Incorporation by a Foreign National or a NRI?</strong></p>\n<p>The documents which are required by foreign nationals residing in any foreign country for incorporating a company in India are:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Passport</li>\n<li>Address proof such as driving license, bank statement or any utility bill (not older than two months)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All the above said documents must be notarised by a Public Notary and be apostilled by the competent authority in their country of residence.</p>\n<p>The documents which are required by foreign residents residing in India for incorporating a company are:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Resident permit</li>\n<li>Passport</li>\n<li>Business visa</li>\n<li>Bank statement or any utility bill (not older than two months)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All the above said documents must be attested by the Consulate of the Foreign Embassy in India.</p>\n<p>The documents which are required by NRIs for incorporating a company in India are:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Proof of identity</li>\n<li>PAN card</li>\n<li>Aadhaar card, driving license, voter ID, if any</li>\n<li>Current address proof such as a copy of the driving license, bank statement or any utility bill in the country of residence (not older than two months)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The current address proof must be notarised by a Public Notary in the country of residence and apostilled by the Indian Embassy in the foreign country.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the process of a Company Registration in India?</strong></p>\n<p>The process of a company registration in India by foreign and NRI directors are similar to incorporating a company in India by the Indian directors.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>All the directors need to obtain a DSC</li>\n<li>All the directors need to obtain a DIN</li>\n<li>Registration on the MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) portal and filing of Form</li>\n<li>Uploading the required documents along with the MoA, AoA.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And thereafter soon the Registrar will issue the Incorporation Certificate after verification of the application and all the submitted documents.</p>\n<p><strong>How can we help you with your business set up in India?</strong></p>\n<p>We can assist you in registering your company in India by obtaining important documents and approval from the government.

There are two Acts in India that deals with an individual (particularly an Indian Resident or Foreign Resident) who undertakes border transactions and hence these two laws are – (i) Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999 and (ii) Companies Act, 2013. It is very pertinent to note that both the above laws must be complied with while entering into a Cross Border Transaction.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cross border merger and acquisitions are deals between foreign companies and domestic firm in the target country.

I was continuously avoiding him and one day I burst out with anger and told him - I got these because of my experience and my ability to perform my role flawlessly, not to indulge his uncanny wishes. He took revenge on me and that's how my bullying days started -</p>\n<p>Everyone in the office stops talking to me suddenly, even asking them any questions they never replied with care, I started feeling I'm invisible. All my job responsibility taken away and I was told to go out and do random visits to clients which were not part of my job profile, I was given a computer and a small sitting arrangement but I had no work. The whole day I use to wait for my boss to call me and give me a lecture on how to maintain a call sheet and how many clients I had visited. When I questioned him that is not under my job responsibility he denied that and he said that's all he had to offer me in this company. Tears used to fall from my eyes, but no one to share, every single day - it was like tracking over a mountain and unable to see what comes next. Suddenly I was informed I had to report to another person including him, she was the GM of the company but her department was different, I had no option but to agreed, so every single day I had to knock on two doors to say good-morning, every time I go out to visit I had to inform both of them. While sending an e-mail to my clients I had to tag my bosses, where there was no valid reason for them to be in that email. All my colleagues behaved with me as if I'm a criminal and had no place to work with them. The housekeeper use to misbehave whenever asking him to do anything - like he used to keep a nice glass in each of us table but for me, there was no arrangement as such I had to ask for a bottle every time I feel thirsty, I had been removed from two projects and placed with sales officer even being a Chief manager of the company, my performance use to be appraised in front of my reportees. I had no idea what should I do? I tried to talk to him but every time he ignored me like I'm dead. I tried to talk to one of my colleagues but he informed that to the GM and the whole story got licked in a second to the boss. Every one of them was against me, every one of them was hateful and abusive towards me.</p>\n<p>Situations like that may occur in anyone's life - things which I did understand after going through such trauma that how it impacts your life and the organization too. The problem with my company there was no one to reach after my boss, so the organization had not developed an employee-centric culture where an employee can reach out for help if needed.</p>\n<p>How Bullying at your workplace can affect your life?</p>\n\n<p>If you're being bullied, you may:</p>\n<p>• feel sick or anxious before work or when thinking about work</p>\n<p>• have physical symptoms, such as digestive issues or high blood pressure</p>\n<p>• have a higher risk for type 2 diabetes</p>\n<p>• have trouble waking up or getting quality sleep</p>\n<p>• have somatic symptoms, such as headaches and decreased appetite</p>\n<p>Mental health effects of bullying</p>\n\n<p>• thinking and worrying about work constantly, even during time off</p>\n<p>• dreading work and wanting to stay home</p>\n<p>• needing time off to recover from stress</p>\n<p>• losing interest in things you usually like to do</p>\n<p>• increased risk for depression and anxiety</p>\n<p>• suicidal thoughts</p>\n<p>• low self-esteem</p>\n<p>• self-doubt, or wondering if you've imagined the bullying</p>\n\n<p>Workplaces with high rates of bullying can also experience negative consequences, such as:</p>\n<p>• financial loss resulting from legal costs or bullying investigations</p>\n<p>• decreased productivity and morale</p>\n<p>• increased employee absences</p>\n<p>• high turnover rates</p>\n<p>• poor team dynamics</p>\n<p>• reduced trust, effort, and loyalty from employees</p>\n<p>When bullying isn't addressed, it becomes easier for people to continue bullying, especially when the bullying is subtle. Bullies who take credit for work or intentionally make others look bad may end up receiving praise or being promoted.</p>\n<p>What to do if you're being bullied at work-</p>\n<p>Well, I can tell you with my experience -</p>\n<p>When experiencing bullying, it's common to feel powerless and unable to do anything to stop it. If you try to stand up to the bully, you may be threatened or told no one will believe you. If it's your manager bullying you, you may wonder who to tell.</p>\n<p>First, take a moment to remind yourself that bullying is never your fault, regardless of what triggered it. Even if someone bullies you by making it seem like you can't do your job, bullying is more about power and control, not your workability.</p>\n<p>I tried to reach out everywhere - to my colleagues, to the head-office but no one comes forward to support me, your situation may not be as worst as mine but still, legal steps were there which I didn't take because of my unwillingness to fight with them anymore but if you have somewhere to reach out, do not stop doing these following mentioned steps.</p>\n<p>Begin to take action against bullying with these steps:</p>\n<p>Document the bullying -Keep track of all bullying actions in writing. Note the date, the time, where the bullying took place, and other people who were in the room.</p>\n<p>Save physical evidence- Keep any threatening notes, comments, or emails you receive, even if they're unsigned. If there are documents that can help prove to bully, such as denied PTO requests, overly harsh commentary on assigned work, and so on, keep these in a safe place.</p>\n<p>Report the bullying- Your workplace may have a designated person you can talk to if you don't feel safe talking to your direct supervisor. Human resource is a good place to start. It's also possible to talk about the bullying with someone higher up if your supervisor is unhelpful or if the person doing the bullying.</p>\n<p>Confront the bully- If you know who's bullying you, bring along a trusted witness, such as a co-worker or supervisor, and ask them to stop - if you feel comfortable doing so. Be calm, direct, and polite.</p>\n<p>Review work policies- Your employee handbook may outline steps of action or policies against bullying. Also, consider reviewing state or even federal policies about the type of bullying you're experiencing.</p>\n<p>Seek legal Guidance-Consider talking to a lawyer, depending on the circumstances of the bullying. Legal action may not always be possible, but a lawyer can offer specific advice.</p>\n<p>Reach out to Others-Co-workers may be able to offer support. Talking to your loved ones about bullying can also help. You can also talk to a therapist. They can provide professional support and help you explore ways to cope with the effects of bullying while you take other actions.</p>\n<p>If you're a member of a union, your union representative may be able to offer some guidance and support on how to deal with bullying.</p>\n<p>You can also look into your employer's employee assistance program if they have one. EAPs help you access resources to address a variety of issues that can affect your mental health and overall well-being.</p>\n<p>How to help when you witness bullying</p>\n<p>If you witness bullying, speak up! People often say nothing out of fear they'll become targets, but ignoring bullying contributes to a toxic work environment.</p>\n<p>Workplace policies against bullying can help people feel safer about speaking up when they see bullying happen.</p>\n\n<p>• Offering support. Support could involve acting as a witness if the person targeted wants to ask the bully to stop. You can also help by going to HR with your co-worker.</p>\n<p>• Listening. If your co-worker doesn't feel safe going to HR, they may feel better-having someone to talk to about the situation.</p>\n<p>• Reporting the incident. Your account of what happened could help your management team realize there's a problem.</p>\n<p>• Staying close to your co-worker, when possible. Having a supportive co-worker nearby could help reduce instances of bullying.</p>\n<p><strong>TAKE AWAY&nbsp;</strong>-</p>\n<p>Bullying is a serious issue, many talents left the organization, much even suicide and take their own life, many got mental issues because of the trauma they faced, they never can work with the same confidence, may not come out from the trauma, and never attempt to work again. While many companies have a zero-tolerance policy, bullying can sometimes be hard to recognize or prove, making it difficult for managers to take action. Organizations have to take initiatives to have a strict unbiased rule on such bullying, more than 30% of employees suffer from this mental stress while working in an organization. An organization should be a place of work and performance, not a place for taking personal revenge based on grandiosity and biasedness. It is unfortunate when someone left the organization without even getting an opportunity to even express what they had gone through. Someone has to give up on them long before they started their career in a full-fledged. This has to stop by spreading awareness and reaching out to those who are now seemingly looking for help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the Author </strong>: Adya Chakraborty is a Corporate Trainer, Motivational Speaker, Psychological Counsellor and Mindfulness Coach.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\n\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Amy, a Czechican, is an accountant- 9 to 7 desk job- and loves travelling. Like many of us, she doesn't enjoy the work but is working as it pays her bills. Deep inside, Amy wants to set up a business and get her freedom back.</p>\n<p>Amy visits India on vacation- her business mind follows her wherever she goes. She arrives at Vadodra, a city located in Western India. The business mind overpowers her leisure mind as she observes that a good cab service is missing in the city. She sets aside her tourist plans. Amy says, \"this may be my chance to escape the 9 to 7 desk job.\"  Like a person on a mission, she researches about the cab market, and her business mind is right- reliable and well-connected cab service is missing in the city.</p>\n<p>Being an accountant, Amy quickly figures the finances for her business. But the legal part is a challenge- Amy had many questions in her mind.</p>\n<p>Amy's first question is, \"Are foreigners allowed to set up business in India?\" Yes, Amy. India more than welcomes foreign investors.</p>\n<p>If I set up a business in India, what should be my business structure? Amy's next question.</p>\n<p>Indian laws stop foreigners from starting a proprietorship or partnership or One Person Company in India. A foreigner can invest in L.L.P., but before that, they need permission from the R.B.I. Amy is agitated. She says: Why the Indian government has a problem with foreigners investing or setting up a business? It's a colonial hangover, Amy.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Amy, you can set up your business as a private limited company or a public limited company. Amy is happy that the Indian government has not closed all doors for foreigners. But she is also confused: Amy goes \"Public or Private\"? Private is the way to go, whether its professional or personal. Amy remembers that her mom has always told her not to announce her plans to the world. Her mom says, and I agree with her mom: \"We are living in a world where people you come across or interact daily with want you to fail more than succeed.  Just go about your business silently- at least initially.</p>\n<p>Okay! Enough appeal to feelings. Business decisions are based on logic, not feelings. So, Amy, for the logical side of yours:</p>\n<p>To start a public company, Amy, you require a minimum of seven members, whereas a private limited company requires minimum of two members.</p>\n<p>A public company must call a statutory general meeting of members. Private companies may call a general meeting if they want to ensure the members are still members of the company.</p>\n<p>Private companies can start the business after incorporation, but public companies can only start the business after receiving a commencement certificate.</p>\n<p>Long story short: Amy, private companies, have fewer laws and procedures to comply with.</p>\n<p>Amy's next question: \"How do I begin the company registration process? What documents I have to submit?\"</p>\n<p>Before I answer that, Amy, I would like you to know that the company registration process is called incorporation. At the end of the registration process, Amy, you will get an incorporation certificate. The certificate attests that the company is established according to the laws of the country.</p>\n<p>Now for all the budding foreign entrepreneurs, and especially for Amy's dream, I present the registration process.</p>\n<p>The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (M.C.A.), India, has made the registration process online. Amy is excited and immediately thinks of resigning as registration will be a quick one. But Amy's mother asks her to put the resignation plan on hold and find more about the registration process. As always, Amy listens to her mom.</p>\n<h4><strong>Step 1 </strong></h4>\n<p>Amy, you need to digitally sign the forms that you submit online for the registration. As a digital signature is a must, you must get a digital signature or D.S.C. D.S.C. is also a must for all subscribers and witnesses in the memorandum and articles of association.</p>\n<p>Patience Amy. I will explain what the Memorandum of association (M.O.A ) and Articles of association (A.O.A) are later.</p>\n<h4><strong>Step2</strong> [DIN-Director Identification Number]</h4>\n<p>Every company must have a board of directors. Amy, it is like aeroplanes having pilots. Will you board an aeroplane that doesn't have pilots? The Board of directors consists of individual directors. Public company require a minimum of three directors, whereas private company require two.  DIN is a must for anyone who wants to become a director in a company. At least one director must be an Indian resident.</p>\n<p>The documents that Amy needs for getting the DIN and D.S.C. are:</p>\n<p>Proof of identity. P.A.N. for Indians and Passport for foreigners</p>\n<p>Copy of driving license, bank statement or any utility bill (not older than two months).</p>\n<p>Residence permits for foreigners if residing in India.</p>\n<p>Passport size photograph.</p>\n<p>All the above documents must be notarized or consularized or apostilled by the competent authority in your country.</p>\n<h4>Step 3 [Name approval]</h4>\n\n\n<p>Getting approval for company name through RUN [Reserve Unique Name]. The form allows two proposed names and one re-submission.</p>\n\n<p>Amy, you can apply for the proposed name through SPICEe (INC-32). I know Indians love spices.</p>\n<h4><strong>Step 4</strong> Form SPICe [INC-32]</h4>\n<p>SPICe [INC-32] is a form that Amy needs to fill for company registration- Electronic incorporation. Through this form, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apply for allotment of DIN</li>\n<li>Reserve company name</li>\n<li>Incorporate a company</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Apply for P.A.N. and TAN</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A professional must endorse the form. The endorsement signifies that particulars in the form is correct. The professional can be C.A., C.S., or Advocate</p>\n<h4>Step 5 E-MOA [INC-33] and E-AOA [INC-34]</h4>\n<p>Amy, you must file the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association digitally along with the above documents. The proposed directors and shareholders must have signed the documents.</p>\n<p>For documents signed outside India, the public notary of the residence country must notarize the documents, and it should also be consular zed, or a competent authority must apostille  the documents.</p>\n<p>For documents signed in India, A copy of the visa and stamped passport proves the applicant's presence in India when signing the documents.</p>\n<h4>Step 6 P.A.N. and T.A.N. application</h4>\n<p>P.A.N. [Form 49 A] and T.A.N. [FORM 49 B]. Once you submit the SPICe form, the system auto-generates the P.A.N. and T.A.N. forms.</p>\n\n<p>Private companies can start with any <a href=\"https://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/AmendmentAct_2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">capital amount</a>.</p>\n<p>Minimum two shareholders for a private company. None of them must be Indian residents. Shareholders can be entities, individuals, or both.</p>\n<p>The M.O.A and A.O.A are documents needed when setting up a company. The M.O.A tells the outsider what a company does and what it can do.</p>\n<p>The A.O.A informs the reader about the company's internal rules and policies. It tells the reader how a company does what it does.</p>\n<p>I hope I have answered your queries Amy. If I come across anything new about company registration, I will let you know.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<!-- /wp:fl-builder/layout -->",

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>What is an international tax treaty?</p>\n<p>Treaty is an international agreement between two states, and international law governs the terms of the treaty. An international tax treaty is a bilateral agreement between countries for preventing double taxing their respective citizens' active or passive income. Lately, international tax treaties deal with many subjects apart from double taxation.</p>\n<p>Income tax treaties lay down the tax amount that a county can levy on taxpayers' income, capital, estate, or wealth.</p>\n<p>Tax havens</p>\n<p>Tax havens are tax-free or low tax places or countries. The tax-free setup attracts foreign investors to establish a business there. Typically, these countries are not parties to international tax treaties.</p>\n<p>Understanding tax treaty</p>\n<p>When a foreign national or company invests, the issue is which country has the right to tax that individual or firm. Whether the receiving country (capital/investment) or the country where the investors have their residence? The receiving country is the country that receives capital or investment from the investor. It is precisely to avoid double taxing the same investor's same income that countries sign a tax treaty. These agreements are identified as double taxation avoidance agreements (DTTAAs).</p>\n<p>Trade will flourish between two countries when these countries' governments will not burden the relevant service providers with double tax. Treaties keep the above objective at the centre and allocate the right to tax based on certain principles between parties to treaty.</p>\n<p>The countries resort to tax credit or tax exemption to avoid double taxing the investor. A tax credit, for example, ensures that the residence country refunds tax paid by an investor in the source country or capital importing country, and the converse.</p>\n<p>Under tax exemption, the investor is exempted from tax in the host country or place of the residence country.</p>\n<p>Types of DTAA</p>\n<p>DTAAs are of two types:</p>\n<p>1) Comprehensive: These cover a wide range of incomes provided under different tax model conventions</p>\n<p>2) Limited: These are restricted in scope and cover fewer types of income. For example, DTAA between India and Pakistan is limited to shipping and aircraft profits only.</p>\n<p>Individuals or organizations who are taxed by authorities have the alternative to choose which tax laws that are, DTTA or national income tax law, must apply to them.</p>\n<p>Indian Income-tax law</p>\n<p>Further, sec. 90 (2) of the Indian Income Tax Act provides the assessee with the alternative to choose Tax law that the authorities must apply to them. The choice is between DTTA or the Income Tax Act.</p>\n<p>DTAA implementing</p>\n<p>1. The first step is to identify whether the convention applies to the issue at hand. Whether the taxpayer falls within the ambit of the convention, it is crucial to ascertain the applicability of the convention. It involves determining the residential status of the taxpayer.</p>\n<p>Treaty must be in effect for the relevant period that the country seeks to tax the income.</p>\n<p>2. The relevant definitions must be applied.</p>\n<p>3. Identify the provisions that apply to various categories of income, capital gains or capital.</p>\n<p>4. Apply the substantive provisions</p>\n<p>a) The source state may tax without any restriction</p>\n<p>b) The source state can tax up to a limit: upper ceiling</p>\n<p>c) The source state may not tax, and the residence state has a right to tax the specific transaction</p>\n<p>Illustration</p>\n<p>The problem of double taxation can be better understood through this illustration of how countries may treat interest income received from a loan granted by a lender. The lender is a citizen of the U.S, resides in Canada, and has granted a loan to a Guatemalan citizen. Three countries, i.e., Canada, the U.S. and Guatemala, can tax the interest earned by the lender. The U.S can assert its right to tax based on the lender's citizenship, Canada can claim to tax the interest originating from the residence of the lender, and Guatemala can tax the interest received based on source jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>DTAAs ensures that countries do not tax the same income earned by an individual or a firm.</p>\n<p>Tax treaties, including DTAAs, are based on one of the two models: The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model and the United Nations (U.N.) Model Convention.</p>\n<p>We will discuss the two models in this section.</p>\n<p>OECD model</p>\n<p>Partnership</p>\n<p>We have uncertainty regarding countries applying the convention's provisions to partnerships. While some countries treat partnerships as taxable units, some countries treat individual partners' income from the partnership as taxable units and ignore the partnership's income as a whole for taxing. We call the latter approach as the fiscally transparent approach.</p>\n<p>The countries understand the need for effectively administering tax rules that will prevent tax evasion through information sharing and aid in collecting taxes.</p>\n<p>Incomes that country can tax under OECD</p>\n<p>According to the OECD model, the incomes mentioned below can be taxed without restraint in the State of source:</p>\n<p>· Income from immovable property situated in that State –</p>\n<p>· permanent establishment's profit located in that State, gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment, and capital representing movable property forming part of the business property of such a permanent establishment</p>\n<p>· Artistes' and Sportsmen's income generated from activities in that State</p>\n<p>· Private sector Employees' remuneration in that State unless the employee remains in that State for a period not exceeding 183 days in the 12 months commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned</p>\n<p>· Except in a few cases, remuneration and pensions received for government service rendered</p>\n<p>Incomes that state tax limitedly:</p>\n<p>Dividends: where the holding that pays the dividend is not related or connected to a permanent establishment in the source state, the respective State must limit its tax rate to 5% of gross dividend amount,</p>\n<p>Where the beneficiary is a holding company that holds directly, in the previous year, at least 25% of companies' capital, the company that pays the dividend</p>\n<p>The source state must not tax the interest more than 10% of the interest gross amount</p>\n<p>Other income or capital may not be taxed in the State of source or situs; as a rule, they are taxable only in the State of residence of the taxpayer</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge while negotiating a tax treaty is to what extent the source county must relinquish its taxing rights. A source country is that hosts the investment or capital importing country. In contrast, the residence country is where the investor resides or has resided for a certain period in the immediately preceding days.</p>\n<p>If the host country relinquishes its right to tax, the residence country taxes the profits of the investor. However, where the host country taxes the investor, the residence country will credit tax amount that the investor has paid in the host country. And if the investor still needs to pay tax in the residence country, in cases, where the tax rate is higher than the host country, the investor must pay the differential tax amount.</p>\n<p>U.N. Model</p>\n<p>Art 1 states that the convention will apply to people who are residents of one or both contracting parties.</p>\n<p>Art 2 mentions that convention will apply to taxes both on income and capital.</p>\n<p>Art 4 defines resident, and Art5 explains permanent establishment. These two concepts are crucial for identifying which State has the authority to tax.</p>\n<p>Difference between U.N. and OECD model</p>\n<p>The two models are different because the developed countries drafted the OECD model; in contrast, the U.N. model espouses the developing countries' interests. OECD model favours a more lenient tax regime concerning source jurisdiction-yielding of developing countries' power to tax foreign investment flowing into their country. On the other hand, the developing country wants to retain authority to tax the foreign investments befitting their circumstances.</p>\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n<p>A uniform tax regime aids in the growth of global trade, and along with it, the countries that participate in the international trade benefit from trade between countries. Both developing and developed countries</p>\n<!-- /wp:fl-builder/layout -->",

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<h1>A brief introduction on Trademarks and Artistic work</h1>\n<p>Intellectual property is a creation of the mind; the property is intangible and provides the owner with some exclusive rights over it. The properties include literary, artistic or musical work; it can also include designs, scientific inventions, words, and even symbols.&nbsp; The intellectual property rights are divided into four broad categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copyright</li>\n<li>Trademarks</li>\n<li>Design rights</li>\n<li>Patents</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Trademarks</h2>\n<p>Trademarks are signs, symbols, words or an expression that are used to differentiate the goods or services of one person from another.</p>\n<h2>Artistic Work</h2>\n<p>Artistic work is a creation that includes photographs, paintings, sculptures, charts, cartoons, diagrams, etc. and these works are usually protected by way of <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/\">copyright</a>. Although in this article, we will see the need for trademarks in artistic work.</p>\n<h1>The interplay between IP and Media Law</h1>\n<p>Intellectual Property Rights provide exclusive rights to authors and owners of the creation. These rights prevent the works from being exploited and provide monetary gains which act as an incentive for others to create. The media industry provides consumers with a source of entertainment through feature films, television series or music videos, and all of the media has an underlying bundle of rights. The underlying rights are intellectual property rights that prevent the use of such works if the creator does not permit so.</p>\n<h1>Copyright in Artistic work</h1>\n<p>The Berne Convention was ratified in 1887 and is an international agreement that aims to protect literary and artistic works. The work is protected for 50 years after the death of the author. For cinematographic films, it goes up to 50 years after the first showing or creation. The Copyright Act 1957 in India also takes from the Berne Convention and provides for copyright for artistic work.</p>\n<p>But there are some drawbacks for a work protected through copyright:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong><u>Slow sharing of work</u></strong> – Copyright gives the creator the right to allow someone else to use or reproduce their work. And bars people from openly using such work even if they don’t intend to gain profit from it. Hence, the original work gets circulated slowly.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Ideas aren’t protected</u></strong> – Copyrights do not protect the ideas of a creator; they only protect the expression of such an idea. If someone has an idea, but another person expresses it in a tangible form, the latter gets the copyright.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Trademarks in artistic works</h1>\n<p>A trademark is different than copyright in various aspects. Copyright arises as soon as the creator does the work and can be claimed for a limited period. A trademark has to be registered at a trademark office and can last forever if it is renewed in a proper way. But even when trademarks are not registered, they can gain value through use over a long period and get associated with a service or a product. And nobody else is allowed to use or associate the said trademark with their goods or services. When a trademark is not registered, and someone else uses it and causes damage to the goodwill of the business, a remedy for passing off is available. But the action is difficult to maintain and hence it is advised to get a trademark registered.</p>\n<p>The two broad aspects of the entertainment industry include music and film. And even though copyright exists for the artistic works in this industry, trademarks can be used in certain respects.</p>\n<p>The following areas of the media industry can be provided with trademarks:</p>\n<h2>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Song titles</h2>\n<p>The first song to have trademark protection was “Why this Kolaveri Di?” (the first line), the trademark was filed as a wordmark under class 9 (cinematographic apparatus and instruments, apparatus for recording and reproduction of sounds and images), and class 41 (entertainment services) to protect the lyrics of the song (Application No. 2246257). The song was a Tamil-English song that had become an instant hit on all social media platforms. The act helped Sony (The music company that recorded the song) launch many products like CDs and cassettes (under class 9) and prevented others from using goodwill and repute received by Sony.</p>\n<p>But the Indian Trademark law does not protect if the trademark has not been in use for five years. Hence, if an applicant files for the trademark to restrain others from registering the same, it becomes unfair. Trademark is provided when the title achieves a secondary meaning or a distinctiveness as being associated with the work created, thereby protecting brand image of the work.</p>\n<h2>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Film titles</h2>\n<p>Every literary work and entertainment work needs a distinct title to help people distinguish their work from others. And the term <a href=\"https://www.mondaq.com/india/trademark/455412/film-titles-and-their-protection\">“literary title”</a> covers both such works.</p>\n<p>The Indian Copyright law does not confer the copyright to only <a href=\"https://www.mondaq.com/india/copyright/697034/no-copyright-protection-for-film-titles\">“the title”</a> of a literary work. But such a title can be protected under the Trademarks Act, 1999.</p>\n<p>Film titles are of two kinds:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong><u>Title of a series of films</u></strong> – Trademark can be easily acquired for the title of a series of film, for e.g. Dhoom (Application nos. 2193798, 2095311 and 1319835) and Munna Bhai (1780467, 1780364). But for single literary work, where the title is not used for sequels or prequels, another test needs to be passed.</li>\n<li><strong><u>Title for a single literary work</u></strong> - To be trademarked, the title needs to acquire a secondary meaning. Secondary meaning is achieved when potential buyers or users would be able to associate the title with specific work, and this might cause confusion about the origin, or association of any other title. Even for an unreleased work, a good amount of pre-release publicity can also provide secondary meaning.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Landmark cases that paved the way (India)</h1>\n<h2>Sholay Media and Entertainment Pvt Ltd. V. Parag M. Sanghavi 223 (2015) DLT 152, MIPR 2015 (3) 0096</h2>\n<p>The movie “Sholay” was released in the year 1975, and was one of the most popular movies of that time. The movie was known widely, and people associated the title with the Sippys (Producer), hence the title had a secondary meaning. In 2007, Ram Gopal Varma had produced a movie titled “Ram Gopal Varma ke Sholay” and was sued for trademark infringement. He then changed the name of the movie to “Ram Gopal Varma ke Aag”.</p>\nKanungo Media (P) Ltd. vs RGV Film Factory And Ors. 138 (2007) DLT 312<br>\nKanungo Media had produced a Bengali movie called “Nishabd”; it had won many awards. But could not be released on a commercial scale. They had then filed for a permanent injunction against the use of their movie title “Nishabd” by Ram Gopal Verma. Since the movie could not be released, it was not popular, and the title acquired no secondary meaning. The High court of Delhi hence dismissed the application and Ram Gopal Varma named his Hindi movie “Nishabd”.\n<h1>Position in The United States of America</h1>\n<p><strong><u>Song Title</u></strong> – In the US, a song title can only be trademarked if it has achieved a level of popularity.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Movie Title – </u></strong>The US Patent and Trademark Office does not provide a trademark to titles that relate to a single movie or television show. It registers a title only if the title is associated with a movie series or a television show, any work that is continuing. The USPTO does not provide a trademark to a single title unless it has been promoted widely or has garnered fame.</p>\n<h1>Concluding remarks</h1>\n<p>The aim of trademarks is to differentiate the goods and services of one person from another. The title of a movie or a song helps the audience associate a particular work and differentiates it with the work of others hence is of utmost importance. Copyright provides no protection to titles per se and hence the need for trademarks arises. Trademarks can protect such titles. Once registered, the trademark can only be used by the registered user and bars unauthorised use of the same. It also allows the user to seek damages or injunction upon infringement of such mark. Hence, a trademark provides for a legal remedy for the injured party in a court of law in a case where copyright does not even provide a right.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>About the author: Swarneeka R.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<h3><strong>Who can inherit property</strong></h3>\n<p>Indian citizens can inherit properties in India without any restrictions. However, when we talk about foreign citizens and Indian citizens living abroad, the situation is not the same. To understand the law regarding inheritance of such persons, we need to understand the following terms:</p>\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li><strong>Foreigner</strong>: The term foreigner has been defined in the Foreigners Act, 1946 as ‘a person who is not a citizen of India’.</li>\n<li><strong>NRI</strong>: In simple terms, Non-Resident Indian (“NRI”) can be defined, as an Indian citizen who has relocated to another country, which is no longer ‘resident’ in India. More clarity regarding this can be found in the Income-tax Act, 1961, which does not directly define NRI but defines who can be considered as a resident in Section 6. Therefore, interpreting the section, the following criteria can be laid down for someone to be considered as NRI:</li>\n<li>A person who has stayed less than 182 days in the current financial year in India; or</li>\n<li>A person who has stayed in India for less 365 days in the preceding four years and has stayed less than 60 days in that current financial year.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a person fulfils even one of the above-mentioned conditions, he shall be regarded as a ‘non-resident.’</p>\n<p><strong>FEMA defines a person resident in India as</strong></p>\n<p>a person residing in India for more than one hundred and eighty-two days during the preceding financial year <strong>but does not include</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;(A) a person who has gone out of India or who stays outside India, in either case—</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(a) for or on taking up employment outside India, or</p>\n<p>(b) for carrying on outside India a business or vocation outside India, or</p>\n<p>c) for any other purpose, in such circumstances as would indicate his intention to stay outside India for an uncertain period;</p>\n<p>(B) a person who has come to or stays in India, in either case, otherwise than—</p>\n<p>(a) for or on taking up employment in India, or</p>\n<p>(b) for carrying on in India a business or vocation in India, or</p>\n<p>(c) for any other purpose, in such circumstances as would indicate his intention to stay in India for an uncertain period;</p>\n<p>(2) any person or body corporate registered or incorporated in India,</p>\n<p>(3) an office, branch or agency in India owned or controlled by a person resident outside India,</p>\n<p>(4) an office, branch or agency outside India owned or controlled by a person resident in India;</p>\n<p>Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 uses the term “person resident outside India”&nbsp; for NRIs and defines it as a person who is not resident in India.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PIO:</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/CountryQuickLink/703_PIO-OCI.pdf\">Ministry of External Affairs</a> defines Person of Indian Origin (PIO) as a foreign citizen (except a national of Pakistan, Afghanistan Bangladesh, China, Iran, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal):</li>\n<li>Who at any time held an Indian passport; or</li>\n<li>Either of their parents/ grandparents/ great grandparents were born and permanently resident in India as defined in Government of India Act, 1935 and other territories that became part of India thereafter provided neither was at any time a citizen of any of the aforesaid countries ( as referred above); or</li>\n<li>Who is a spouse of a citizen of India or a PIO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The economic, financial, and educational benefits given to them are usually at parity with NRIs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Who can they inherit from</strong></h3>\n<p>NRIs, PIO, and even foreign citizens can inherit any type of property, including movable and immovable property, i.e. commercial, agricultural, and residential. <strong>It is pertinent to note that NRI cannot acquire agricultural land, farmhouse, and plantation property in India, but they can inherit the same subject to certain restrictions</strong>. They can also inherit properties from other NRIs and PIOs if certain conditions are fulfilled. Therefore, they can inherit property from two categories of people:</p>\n<p>Any person resident in India; or</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>A person resident outside India</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the things required to enable NRIs to inherit the property is that the property, at the time of the purchase, should be in compliance with the relevant laws. That is the person bequeathing the property should have complied with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”) Regulations or any other foreign exchange law in force at the time of acquisition of the property in question. Non-compliance with the same can result in non-inheritance of the property.</p>\n<h3><strong>In what ways can they inherit the property?</strong></h3>\n<p>As a general rule, people, including NRIs, can inherit a property in the following ways:</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li><strong>Will:</strong> One of the ways that NRIs can inherit properties in India is through a Will. NRIs themselves can transfer the property to other NRIs by making through a Will. However, in the said circumstance, the permission of RBI will be required.</li>\n<li><strong>Intestate:</strong> If a person dies intestate, i.e. without a Will, then the inheritance process can get a little difficult. The relevant provision of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 and shall apply. An NRI would have to apply for a succession certificate to the Courts. For this several documents including the death certificate of the relative, birth certificate, purchase deed, registration documents, bank documents, etc. have to be produced to prove that you are the rightful heir to the property.</li>\n<li><strong>Gift:</strong> An Indian resident can gift a property to an NRI residing outside India. The same shall not be taxable. However, there is one restriction. Agricultural land and farmhouse cannot be gifted to a person residing outside India. Therefore, NRIs cannot receive agricultural land as a gift.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Tax Implications</strong></h3>\n<p>No tax is payable in by NRIs, PIOs, or foreign citizens at the time of inheritance. Previously, Wealth Tax would have been levied depending on the price of the estate. However, since the same has been abolished, tax will not be levied on the inheritance of a property per se. However, &nbsp;if the NRI decides to sell the property or accrues some kind of income from it, the question of Income Tax arises.</p>\n<p>The following options are available to NRIs when they inherit property</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li><strong>Continued ownership: </strong>NRIs can decide to keep the property. As mentioned above, no tax shall be payable at the instance of inheritance. If NRI decides to leave the property unoccupied for occupational purposes, then also there would be no tax implications. However if he’s/she owns more than one house, including the rented property, then he will have to pay tax on the same. That is he/she will have to decide to keep one property as self-occupied and furnish estimated rental income, with regards to the other unoccupied properties. The rent would be based on the estimated rent that the property would have furnished if put up in the market.</li>\n<li><strong>Sale or gift:</strong> If the NRI decides to sell his property to another NRI he will have to take permission from the RBI. No such limitation is there when it comes to selling the property to an Indian resident. If NRI decides to sell any agricultural land, it can only be sold to Indian residents. If he sells the property, he will be subject to Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”). He will be subject to 20% tax, unless he reinvests the same in a residential house as per Section 54 and 54F of the IT Act. A NRI may also be subject to tax in his home country if the countries have not signed a Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”). Currently, <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/why-you-should-be-aware-of-double-tax-avoidance-treaties/tetrapak_show/70143405.cms\">India has DTAA with 88 countries</a>, including the US, UK, China, UAE, Singapore, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A foreign national can sell his property in India to an Indian resident, NRI or PIO with the prior permission of RBI. Even a PIO can sell his property in India. However, prior permission of RBI is required to make such a sale to another PIO.</p>\n<p>If NRI decides to gift the property inherited, he may do so. However, it is pertinent to note that agricultural land cannot be gifted. If an NRI, who is not a relative, receives property as a gift from another NRI the same will be subject to tax in India based on the market value of the property.</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li><strong>Repatriation:</strong> NRI can repatriate, i.e. send money from the sale proceeds outside India. Permission of RBI will be required if the sale proceeds exceed 1 million USD. The following restrictions have been put on the repatriation of sale proceeds of inherited property:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The immovable property must have been acquired in accordance with the provisions of the FEMA Regulations or foreign exchange law in force at the time of acquisition.</p>\n<p>The repatriated amount should not exceed (a) the amount paid for acquisition of the immovable property in foreign exchange received through normal banking channels or out of fund held in Foreign currency Non-Resident Account or (b) the foreign currency equivalent as on the date of payment, of the amount paid where such payment was made from the funds held in Non-Resident External account for the acquisition of the property.</p>\n<p>The repatriation of sale proceeds is restricted to not more than two such properties in the case of residential property.</p>\n<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>\n<p>NRIs have leeway to acquire properties except for agricultural land, farmhouse, and plantation property in India. However, NRIs can inherit the above properties-agricultural land, farmhouse and plantation property. Further, NRI can transmit the sale proceeds from land sold in India, although where the amount to be transferred is above one million USD, RBI’s permission is required. These curtailments are present for the stability of the Indian economy- the unwarranted outflow of foreign exchange reserves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong>: Akanksha Singh.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p><strong>Matter Management</strong></p>\n<p>Matter management entails corporate legal work, which is expansive than case management. Managing documents and contracts also form a part of matter management. Matter management process encompasses different aspects of matter like the various class of legal work, attorneys assigned to the case, allocating resources, and other similar aspects. These aspects are monitored, collated, and reported by the legal team that manages the entire process.</p>\n<p>Since corporate legal work is the fulcrum around which matter management revolves, robust Matter managing must be multi-faceted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disputes and Litigation</li>\n<li>Claims</li>\n<li>Intellectual Property</li>\n<li>Contract management</li>\n<li>Legal Research and advisory</li>\n<li>Governance, Compliance and Risk management</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Matter management creates a structure within an organization that ensures managing workflow in a better way, thereby leading to effective legal resource management.</p>\n<p><strong>Case management v Matter Management</strong></p>\n<p>Case management: is not as comprehensive as matter management. Attorneys use case management systems to manage an endless flow of paperwork effectively.&nbsp; It restricts to storing documents in a centralized manner.</p>\n<p>Matter management is broader in scope and entails several aspects of corporate legal practice. It’s not restricted to managing paperwork, though managing paperwork forms a part of the matter management process. &nbsp;It allows users to create and open a matter, assign attorneys and timekeepers to matters, and report on who worked on what matters and for how long, to name a few.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is matter management crucial for organizations?</strong></p>\n<p>An organization’s legal department has various legal issues to take care of. These issues are complex and distinct. Organizations work sans a structured method to resolve these issues. For example, organizations often have no idea about where their legal department are expending resources. Further, how efficiently or inefficiently the legal department is collaborating with external counsels and other resource-draining points are not visible to the organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Issues at any stage</strong></p>\n<p>Any process has several stages, and matters can rear its ugly head at any stage. Once an issue has reared its ugly head, significant time and resource go into finding the relevant documents. In short, the whole process is inefficient. &nbsp;The organizations have several different databases that are not integrated, therefore making the transfer of data back and forth an error-prone exercise.</p>\n<p><strong>Expending resources where it isn’t not required</strong></p>\n<p>Deprived of an organized process, the organization is unaware of the chokepoints in its managing system. Thereby, the organizations continue to operate in a prodigal manner.&nbsp; The organization cannot prioritize the matters, identify loopholes in its legal operations, and control expending their resources over legal issues. Other deleterious impact includes falling behind the deadline, missing project milestones, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>New issues</strong></p>\n<p>The scenario is aggravated when new issues crop up. A disordered process impedes the legal staff vis-à-vis tackling new cases as they are occupied with previous problems. Further, it is possible that a new issue is linked with a previous issue, but the unorganized approach doesn’t identify the common thread. As a result, inefficiency is perpetuated from one stage to another.</p>\n<p><strong>External legal aid</strong></p>\n<p>When an organization associates with outside counsel for resolving legal matters, an unorganized process results in the organization being clueless about vital aspects of the project. For instance, the outside counsel will bill the organization aligning with the number of hours devoted to the organization’s work. However, the organization hasn’t got a process to verify the counsel’s claim.</p>\n<p>Further, frequent updating by the counsel to the in-house counsel will increase the billable hours-resource draining exercise. Issues are complex, and the magnitude of it makes the communicating process a wasteful one for the organization. However, the outside counsel or firm may welcome the above scenario.</p>\n<p>A human-driven and fragmented approach are both wasteful and protracted, which stymies the organization’s growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Vital questions remain unanswered:</strong></p>\n<p>On what basis the organization must pick the firm or counsel for resolving its legal issues when the organization is unaware of crucial facets of the problem?</p>\n<p>How can an organization decide which firm is inefficient, thereby ceasing to assign its work to such firms?</p>\n<p>How to identify the best-suited firm for its work?</p>\n<p>When the parameters to measure the efficiency of firms is absent, how can the organization leverage the work (Quantity and Quality) when negotiating with the firm?</p>\n<p><strong>How does matter management software plug the loopholes?</strong></p>\n<p>It offers an integrated approach wherein the several distinct systems are eliminated; as a result, the data interact with different aspects, and each other, and efficient workflow is created. Further, the software can be tailor-made, aligning with the firm’s requirement.</p>\n<p>The process is streamlined, and a central repository is created. Employees can access the central database, which makes it easier to communicate with internal and external personnel.&nbsp; Furthermore, the organization can analyze the data from the database and eliminate chokepoints, if any, in the system.</p>\n<p>Analyzing data benefits organizations because they can recognize the pattern and proactively prepare a mitigation plan.</p>\n<p>Opening new matters are fast and effective as the process is automated, organized, and template-based.</p>\n<p>These measures eventually lead to cost reduction. According to a report, better work management saves 1.5% of external legal expenses every year.</p>\n<p>Repetitive work and manual work is automated; therefore, in-house counsels can focus on crucial aspects a matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Other benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improving end-user work time owing to centralization</li>\n<li>Faster generation, storage, and reference to legal documents</li>\n<li>Decreased time for creating reports concerning business users</li>\n<li>Automated notifications that reduce the number of manual emails</li>\n<li>Expedited research process</li>\n<li>Streamlined, more efficient allocation of work across resources to maximize productivity</li>\n<li>Improved risk management</li>\n<li>Safer and better compliant data and document practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The organizations that adopt technology purge out the attributes that hinder progress. Manual systems have many shortcomings, as highlighted by this piece. Organizations cannot thrive without harnessing technology to their advantage.&nbsp; Automation removes the deadwood from the organization, making it lighter, thereby organizations can achieve their goals faster. The corporates should understand their needs and choose software aligning with it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong> : <em>Suryash Kumar, working at Vidma Consulting Group LLP, who loves exploring the uncharted territories.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<h3><strong>THE CHANGING PROFILE OF A GENERAL COUNSEL.</strong></h3>\n<p>General Counsel in the current time has vast complex responsibilities. They make sure that the firm gets into the least amount of unnecessary risks. They have a profile that makes it important to act increasingly as an advisor to the CEO for legal and business terms. A lawyer is expected to have a deep knowledge of laws, regulations, and negotiating skills. As professionals, attorneys are trained and valued for their technical skills and expertise.</p>\n<p>While all this adds to the portfolio, in house lawyers still have a part of their job, which is transactional in nature and most overwhelmingly in volume. One aspect of this is the contract drafting and maintaining, which generally is very monotonous and bulky. Many times it is the same template for many contracts, and that can lead to the job being seemingly tedious.</p>\n<p>Contracts define the relationship between the parties and apportion the risk as well. However, during drafting, there is a basic risk of human error. There can be mistakes like miswording or omission resulting in serious calamities for the business.</p>\n<p>Any firm of mid or large size, it will be nearly impossible for the counsel to be in the know of the hundreds of contracts that are made in the firm. What happens when one has to refer to past contracts immediately, they will have to go and search through all the PDFs saved under that particular contract title to find the one needed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>WHAT IS CLM?</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CLM or Contracts Lifecycle Management is a software that helps in contract managing the company at every stage, including performance and renewal or expiry. It leads to significant cost saving and efficiency; understanding and automating also limits the exposure of the company of risking their business by reducing missed obligations.</p>\n<p>CLM has some key steps to it, which makes it an interesting software, which focuses on almost every aspect of a contract. Even though every step is as important as the other one, some have gotten more publicity. For example, for the longest time, managing contracts have been made available, but recently post-execution steps have come to the rise with artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>\n<p>CLM has various steps, and a closer look at them helps with a deeper understanding of how they are good for the general counsel in the current economy.</p>\n<p><strong>Template Authoring</strong>: Simplifying a company’s library of template results in great risk managing. A smart template authoring will allow the general counsel to add clauses to the document, put custom texts and metadata. The process ensures approval before the contract comes into existence.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract Creation</strong>: Contract content is assembled automatically using any criteria associated with the contract, such as region, products, services, or price terms. Rules-based authoring capabilities greatly improve the scalability and agility of contracting operations while also enforcing appropriate process controls.</p>\n<p>The business owners also have a sense of empowerment when there is an option of self-service mode; it also gives the organizer time to achieve revenue and significantly reduces the legal operative expenses.</p>\n<p><strong>Review of Contract</strong>: An automated contract review can result in better negotiating terms and enforcing commercial terms. The software is enabled so that it captures the commercial terms of products and services, prices, discounts, rebates, and incentives in a structured form and integrates the same into enforceable terms.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract Approval</strong>: A good CLM software by design accumulates the workflow and coordinates the approval process, with parallel approves going alongside the contract approval. This is subject to negotiating updates and also ensures governing. A user can also manually intervene with the approval with the help of ad hoc steps.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract Execution</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.icertis.com/blog/nfl-quarterback-josh-mccown-and-the-rise-of-digital-contracts/\">Josh McCown</a> executed a deal worth 10 million dollars from a parking lot and his phone. Executing contracts is highly digitized in the modern-day world. Software as secure as CLM help execute the signature process based on user-defined workflows, all the while updating the contract after the execution.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance</strong>: CLM software of the current time, which gains insight into performance on all areas like finance, legal, and sales. The software consists of an analytical module resulting in the comprehension of data such as renewal, expiry, and procurement, etc. This step helps to track the contract, even third party inclusion, if needed or more complex commitments. Risk can also be managed post-execution.</p>\n<p><strong>Expiry</strong>: The software provides notifying users, including the expiration and renewal alert and notification of contract. Most such software provide the user with a dashboard showing the latest updates on their contracts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>BENEFITS OF CLM</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have understood what a General Counsel does and the software and its various functioning. The question, however, still remains about the efficiency of the software and how it might help the upcoming generation of in house lawyers and general counsel. Here are some key benefits of the software.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Missed renewals and expiry dates, small details a company cannot skip through. CLM this issue. With dedicated software that can keep you informed of these key milestones while providing ready access to key provisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Report Compliance</strong>: For effective contract managing, compliance is key. Meeting contract obligations is pertinent to a company. The threat of contract terminating can be reduced by the proper recording of documents related to the legal requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Centralized Repository</strong>: The central repository is one of the biggest advantages of CLM. It can house all the contracts documenting in the system—a level of transparency that is allowed with the software.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance from suppliers</strong>: Getting suppliers to meet deadlines can seem very difficult and time-consuming; however, a good contract enforces negotiating terms helpful to the business and thus results in cost efficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract cycle improvement: </strong>A typical contract cycle begins when the company recognizes the need for a good or service, and cycle ends at delivery. Generally, the team of lawyers would want to improve the process and reduce cost or improve profit; this could potentially take a lot of time out of their day. However, CLM software may recognize many moving parts that can present opportunities for profit-making.</p>\n<p><strong>Customer – Supplier Relationship</strong>: Contracts are one of the more important documents driving your supplier and customer relationships. To that end, you want to communicate that your business is valuable, reliable, and credible. CLM can help fulfill obligations and go above supplier and customer expectations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>DRAWBACKS OF CLM</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The more I read about the software, I have realized while the software is great for a company with respect to cost efficiency and time management. However, it won’t be a full analysis of the drawbacks that are not taken into account.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.beroeinc.com/blog/contract-lifecycle-management-sneak-seek-of-supplier-landscape/\">high degree of customizin</a>g is needed for each module or template integrating into the software. This is counterproductive to the claim that the software is time-efficient. The software needs data to feed off of which a lawyer from the team has to sit and fill in. In most cases, the software is only updated once a year.</p>\n<h3><strong>How does CLM benefit general counsel or in-house counsel?</strong></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>SPEEDY OUTCOMES</strong></h3>\n<p>General counsels have to deal with multiple contracts at the same time and are under pressure to speed up the completion of such contracts. CLM can help in automating processes like contract creation and approval through standardized rules, which reduces the time taken for each process.</p>\n<h3>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ECONOMICAL</strong></h3>\n<p>CLM helps to manage data in bulk, keep tabs on the status of hundreds of contracts, and helps in easy retrieval of specific data in record time. CLM discards the cost incurred if this were to be done manually using a large workforce and long work hours.</p>\n<h3>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>LESS GRUNT WORK</strong></h3>\n<p>Counsels get more time to provide valuable legal advice and strategies when repetitive tasks of a contract are assigned to a computer. Tasks like creation, approval, and even review of a contract can be automated through user-defined rules. Even the execution of a contract can be digitised with the use of electronic – signature platforms.</p>\n<h3>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>EFFECTIVE COMPLETION OF CONTRACTS</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>A CLM software may create tasks, assign them to parties, and track the completion of such tasks; this reduces the burden on the general counsel to monitor the completion of contracts. The software can also be configured to provide alerts on the completion of tasks.</strong></p>\n<h3>·&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>REDUCES RISKS</strong></h3>\n<p>Since the manual effort of counsels is minimized, the risks of making mistakes and missing timelines are significantly reduced.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>\n<p>For a mid or big tier firm with complex agreements and contracts, an approach that comprehensive in nature paves the way to more control and risk mitigating and, as a result, increases the value attained contracts. However, it is important to select the solutions on the basis of the goals the company has. As there is no one-fits-all solution, organizations with competitive goals should further explore the advantages of contract managing tools and technologies, and find the right fit that matches their unique requirements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong>: A final year student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune, Pragya Bansiwal identifies as an intersectional feminist and is an ardent advocate of queer and minority rights.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>Contract management doesn’t have to be cumbersome and a hassle for the organization. Usually, contract management is associated with stacked up files gathering dust somewhere in the organization, and people rummaging through the files in the hope of getting hold of vital information that the organization needs for a particular purpose- dispute or monitoring deadlines.</p>\n<p>Cloud computing has made it possible for organizations to manage their business from anywhere on the planet. But what is cloud computing? In simple language, cloud computing is providing IT resources over the internet. The pricing depends on the usage of the organization. It benefits the organization since they don’t have to create or build, or service physical data centers or servers. They can access IT services such as computing power, storage, and databases, depending on its need, from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>\n<p><strong>What is Cloud Contract Management?</strong></p>\n<p>Contract management entails several stages that range from pre-executing to post-executing of contract.&nbsp; An operating organization executes several contracts for it to exist as a going concern, and therein lies the rub. It can be challenging for the organization to manage contracts given the volume and complexity of contracts efficiently.</p>\n<p>Cloud Contract management has its root in cloud computing and uses SaaS as software for managing the contract lifecycle. SaaS represents a software distribution model where the Service provider hosts application for customers and customer accesses it over the internet. It doesn’t make use of spreadsheets or offline systems to direct the contract lifecycle.</p>\n<p>Contract management consists of several stages-identifying the needs, negotiation, executing, and other- and for effective management inputs from several sources are required. Cloud Contract management captures data/inputs from various sources. It provides a holistic picture to the organization before it enters into an agreement.</p>\n<p>As a corollary to the above, it helps the organization to manage the contract post-execution better—for instance, meeting deadlines, enforcing their rights, and other similar aspects.</p>\n<p><strong>The fallout of manual or limited automation process</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fragmented approach</strong></p>\n<p>An organization has contracts spread across various departments. The whole process of monitoring the contract becomes inefficient sans centralization. &nbsp;Organizations store data in multiple databases that are not integrated, and thereby constant movement of data back and forth makes contract management a nightmare.&nbsp; As a result, the organization is unaware of the scope of each agreement leading to:</p>\n<p>Falling beyond the project milestone deadlines</p>\n<p>Failing renewals</p>\n<p>Not able to track or streamline contract and vendor spend</p>\n<p>Oblivion to supplier’s obligations under the contract, consequently an increased possibility of a compliance breach</p>\n<p>Expending significant resources on low-value work such as searching for information concerning contract responsibilities</p>\n<p>Contract management involves collaboration among different teams within the organization. To successfully execute a contract, Legal, marketing, finance, and other teams must collaborate, and a fragmented approach doesn’t aid in combining resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Access to data</strong></p>\n<p>Without cloud contract management, access to data entails a resource-draining and tedious exercise. For instance, if the finance team requires project related document, the finance team needs to ask the department that has the document in possession. A possibility exists that although a particular department has access to the document, how does the department ensure that it has the updated document.&nbsp; The whole exercise of communicating and sending emails between departments to get hold of the updated document is unproductive and prodigal.</p>\n<p><strong>Modifying the document</strong></p>\n<p>A contract inevitably gets modified after the parties execute the contract. It may be due to transactional or other factors that warrant the contract to mould according to the prevailing circumstances. In the manual management process, the altering of the contract is fraught with chokepoints that make the exercise a resource depleting one.</p>\n<p><strong>Data entry and management</strong></p>\n<p>Organizations squander their limited resources in data entry and managing. Further, the traditional data managing process requires setting up of expensive hardware and data operating personnel. Nevertheless, data management still exists as an inefficient process within an organization that requires a major overhaul.</p>\n<p><strong>How does Cloud contract management resolve the issues?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Remote access</strong></p>\n<p>The organization’s workforce can access the contract data from anywhere on the planet. They don’t need to drive to the office for feeding contractual data. Therefore, it saves time both for the organization and its workforce.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure access</strong></p>\n<p>The cloud service providers invest considerably in securing data transmission over the internet. They understand these documents contain sensitive data, thereby providing the customers with a safe and secure digital environment. As administrating contract entails several steps- data entry, reporting, searching, tracking, reviews and approvals, termination and renewals- both the staff and management can access the data from anywhere, as a result, better collaboration is witnessed between organization’s departments.</p>\n<p><strong>Bespoke services</strong></p>\n<p>The cloud service providers offer bespoke software that is cut out according to the organization’s needs. It only leaves the organization responsible for providing their employees with the internet and system to access the browser.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>The collaboration and centralized storage enable the organization and concerned personnel to supervise executing or administrating the contract adequately. For instance, any change made by the finance team can be tracked and discussed. It helps in understanding the perspective of different stakeholders and thereby finding a middle ground that incorporates each stakeholder’s interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasonable costs</strong></p>\n<p>The organization doesn’t have to invest in establishing separate hardware or system to integrate the cloud system- the software adapts to the organization and not the other way around.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Organizations can work on actively cooperating at the pre-adoption stage of hiring cloud contract systems-Not just internal but external cooperation. Vendors, suppliers should be consulted, and their views can be sought before adopting cloud contract management.&nbsp; As adopting the system will impact different stakeholders, their interest must be integrated with the system.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, technological tools like A.I, blockchain, cloud computing can only propel the organization towards their goals when they interact synergistically.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong> :&nbsp;<em>Suryash Kumar, working at Vidma Consulting Group LLP, who loves exploring the uncharted territories.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<h1>Why are we talking about LMS?</h1>\n<p>LMS has become an extremely crucial part of not only legal institutions but also to other institutions, including banking, insurance, etc. It improves productivity, expense management, accessibility to legal information, and provides more control over the overall institution so that desired results can be achieved easily. It helps manage multiple litigations constructively irrespective of the field of law.</p>\n<h1>Drawbacks of the present litigation system</h1>\n<p>India, being the largest democracy in the world, faces many problems when it comes to dispensing of justice. Presently, especially because of Covid-19, it is becoming increasingly difficult for litigants and judges to present and adjudge a case while at the same time keeping in mind public safety. Even though the courts have taken certain measures, these are some of the major the litigation system in India faces:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong>The backlog of cases:</strong> Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had announced that as of June 2019 1,58,669 cases were pending in the Supreme Court &nbsp;(\"SC\") and 43 lakh cases are pending in the 25 High Courts in the country, and over 8 lakh of these are over a decade old. He further stated that out of all the cases pending in High Courts <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/out-of-43-lakh-cases-pending-in-high-courts-over-8-lakh-a-decade-old/articleshow/69974916.cms\">18.75 lakh relate to civil matters, and 12.15 lakh are criminal cases.</a> There are many aspects that may be contributing to the backlog of cases such as many courts being understaffed, lack of competent employees, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of accountability transparency:</strong> There is a lack of an accountability system when it comes to the Judiciary. It is not only exempted from the preview of the Right to Information Act, 2005, but also the permission of Chief justice of India needs to be taken before a case can be instituted against a sitting judge. This hinders the administration of justice in a big way.</li>\n<li><strong>Technological Issues:</strong> Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 physical courts operational, therefore, cases are being heard through video conferencing. As rightfully pointed out the Bar Council of India (\"BCI\"), some lawyers are trying to take undue advantage of lockdown. The legal profession is gradually being attempted to be <a href=\"https://www.barandbench.com/news/few-blessed-lawyers-attempting-to-hijack-the-legal-profession-common-advocates-lose-out-bci-to-gather-opinion-on-resuming-regular-courts\">highjacked by a few blessed Lawyers and selected Law-Firms who have high-level connections.</a> The entire system is likely to go out of the hands of common advocates-which is a big concern. Keeping this in mind, BCI had decided to have a discussion with various bar councils and bar associations on the resumption of in-person proceedings. However, it seems like a far-off idea now due to the current pandemic situation deteriorating in the country.</li>\n<li><strong>High Fees being charged by Advocates:</strong> It has almost become a trend amongst advocates to charge unnecessarily high fees. Even though the <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-favours-law-to-regulate-hefty-fees-charged-by-lawyers/story-n1OdH52JcfVi5IPdwPgxvI.html.\">SC has been in talks with the government to set a 'ceiling price'</a> so as to limit the fees, nothing yet has come out of the same yet.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>What do you mean by litigation management software?</h1>\n<p>LMS can be defined as tools built to provide efficiency in the management of various aspects related to litigation. This includes but is not limited to the management of ongoing cases, notices, dates, related documents, and other case information. It seeks to provide accuracy and efficacy in respect of litigation management. It is a relatively new concept but has already become a global industry. The rise in the case fillings and the inefficiency of management techniques has necessitated the need for LMS.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of LMS</h2>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Centralized Repository</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>LMS streamlines and helps organize all activities related to litigation. It provides for a centralized all the legal data. It helps to schedule meetings, making contracts, and assist consumers in accessing, upload, and retrieve the necessary information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased productivity</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The top priority of every institution is to get higher revenue, and LMS facilitates the same. It helps in increasing productivity and reduces the chances of human error. Sometimes documents tend to get lost or incorrectly filed, which can be extremely detrimental to the users. Since LMS performs multiple functions, it helps save time and money on both sides, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction. All of this translates into more profits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Efficient Case Tracking</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Meeting deadlines are extremely important, especially in the legal profession. Lawyers, in general, are responsible for multiple cases and therefore experience a lot of pressure, which increases the chances of human error. A good LMS stores documents, dates, set reminders, send notices, and also sometimes helps to generate receipts and reports.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adaptability</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A good LMS tends to adapt to the needs of the institution and provides a level of flexibility that cannot be achieved through the non-LMS approach. A good LMS should give you the liberty to organize the case files, direct workflow, and should adjust to your requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Safety and Security</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data security is essential to the success of every institution. Usually, manual management leaves room for a lot of room for mistakes. It becomes very difficult to manage multiple cases, to keep the documents safe and is usually extremely time-consuming. A good LMS not only ensures the safety of case files and related documents but also performs data backup.</p>\n<h2>Examples of LMS</h2>\n<p>Various software programs such as Freshsales, ServeManager, Rimus, TheLawAssis, &nbsp;etc. are some of the LMS's available for purchase. Big companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers have also entered into the business of LMS by launching its own LMS. Law firms such as Khaitan and Co., Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, Barucha and Partners, DSK Legal, etc. use a legal software called Practice League for their legal and financial management.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the Indian Judiciary, the Haryana government has set an example for other courts by formulating and implementing its own LMS system to improve the functioning of all the departments and Corporations in the State. It shows various statistics, including the number of users, cases entered, judgments uploaded, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Downsides of LMS</strong></p>\n<p>LMS has brought about a lot of positive changes in the litigation system. However, one of the downsides of LMS is that good quality software is usually very expensive. Even though certain LMS systems are available online for free e.g. ClinicCases there is always the risk of data theft. It may be considered as a non-essential expense by some institutions.</p>\n<p>Another disadvantage of LMS is the lack of law protecting data stored online. Data protection law is at a relatively nascent stage. In India, there is no law the exclusive deals with data protection yet. This might lead to apprehension in the mind of the users, which might make them skeptical about using such tools for case-management for information entered on these platforms could be extremely sensitive and in the wrong hands can be very harmful<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Even though many big institutions usually have LMS, that is not the case in smaller institutions. This may be due to good quality LMS being expensive, as mentioned above, or maybe because of the lack of amongst legal professionals.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>Tools developed to Facilitate Litigation Management</h1>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong>CLM: </strong>Contract Lifecycle Management (\"CLM\") can be said to be a sub-category of LMS. Similar to LMS, it streamlines the process of contract drafting. By formulating a common language pattern, basic templates frequently used terms and clauses, and regularly used conditions it creates reduces the possibility of errors at the same time helps with standardization and regulatory compliances.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SUVAS: </strong>Artificial intelligence is the future of law, and the same has been even recognized by SC. Keeping this in mind, SC has developed various tools to further the administration of justice.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Supreme Court Vidhik Anuvaad Software&nbsp; (\"SUVAS\") is one of those tools developed by SC. It is a language-translation tool that will help to <a href=\"https://main.sci.gov.in/pdf/Press/press%20release%20for%20law%20day%20celebratoin.pdf\">translate judicial documents from English to nine vernacular languages i.e. Marathi, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi, Gujarati, Malayalam and Bengali, and vice versa</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SCI-Interact: </strong>One of the downsides of the present litigation system is the generation of a vast number of documents, which becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Keeping this in mind, the Supreme Court has developed a software called <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/supreme-court-develops-software-to-make-all-its-17-benches-paperless/articleshow/75989143.cms\">SCI-Interact to make all its Benches paperless</a>.&nbsp; Accordingly, this software has five parts, namely canned copies of pending cases, e-filing of fresh cases, IT hardware, MPLS network with dual redundancy, and security audit. This would minimize human interaction and lead to speedy dispensing of justice.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SUPACE: </strong>Another project relating to the software is also in the works<strong>. </strong>Supreme Court Portal for Assistance in Court Efficiency (\"SUPACE\") is a tool being designed that will perform various functions, including data mining, case query, legal research, among other tasks. It is currently being discussed and developed by the AI Committee.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>LMS-Way Forward</h1>\n<p>Modern litigation tools quite ad advanced and his evolving at a rapid pace. Legal technology is an extremely profitable field, with many people investing huge amounts in improving and upgrading various legal tools. In the year 2018 alone, more than <a href=\"https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2018/12/20-important-legal-technology-developments-2018.html\">1 billion dollars was invested in legal tech</a>, with very many mergers and acquisitions taking place. Even Judiciary is taking a stride with countries like Estonia working to develop a 'robot judge' to decide petty matters, i.e., below €7,000. There is little to no information available on the Internet about the usage of LMS; however, it is quite clear that it has greatly benefitted many institutions.</p>\n<p>There still are many institutions that still operate without an LMS, but that is probably because of the misconceptions about the same. Many lawyers are also skeptical about the same. This is not because of lack of technology, but because such drafting tools may lack a certain direction which the lawyer might like to give, it may lack their individualistic style. They feel that one-size-fits-all might not work in the legal field. However, the flip side of this is that the language used might become easier to understand; it may bring about simplicity. There are software programs being developed to provide for a higher degree of customization so as to be more suitable and acceptable to the legal fraternity. As more and more people are learning about LMS and even though are youth is quite well versed with technology and how to use it, the older generation is also becoming more and more comfortable and benefit from the same. Currently, it is seen that most legal tools, including LMS do not have a comprehensive law to govern them and because of the strides being made in the field, such law may become a reality in the future. For example, the American Bar Association (ABA) has already adopted technology competency requirements in their ethical rules so that there is no unwarranted invasion into the client's information to regulate their working.</p>\n<p>In the future, such tools may be used to assess judges, to find appropriate jurisdictions and applicable laws, information about the opposing counsel and parties, to analyze the accuracy of facts, what documents to file, etc. so as to make the case research and presentation more logical and credible. Judges may even make it mandatory to use these tools to bring about consistency in regulatory compliances, amongst other things.&nbsp; Currently, these tools focus on improving the lawyer's efficiency; however, in the future, it will be more client-centric as clients may demand more accuracy in advice through the use of these tools.&nbsp; It will provide a degree of accuracy, speed, and quality, which may be not possible otherwise. Even though it might take years to bring about these changes as a lot of progress has yet to be made, there will surely come a time where it will be unthinkable to litigate without using such tools.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong>: Akanksha Singh.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Case Management – Overview</h2>\n<p>Case Management is a systematic way to help reduce the cost of litigation and effectively manage cases for the benefit of both clients and lawyers. It is an approach that utilizes efficient management techniques to make the attorney-client relationship better and also determine litigation outcomes within a definite cost outline.</p>\n<h2>Effective Case Management – Necessity</h2>\n<p>The legal field has to face challenges like the need to:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Reduce risk</li>\n<li>Predict outcomes with efficiency</li>\n<li>Satisfy the client</li>\n<li>Take actions under a budget constraint.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Law firms have to compete with technology and constantly adapt into the ever-changing market to stay employed. Hence, they need to come up with cost-benefit outcomes and, at the same time, also make enough profit to keep the best talent. Some firms have been able to keep up, but some haven’t been able to move away from prevalent practices.</p>\n<p>The firms that have been able to cut down on accessory and low return practices are doing well. We’ll try to find other ways to achieve similar results.</p>\n<h2>The interdependence of Litigation outcomes and costs</h2>\n<p>The fees charged by a lawyer for the services provided to their clients form the major part of <a href=\"https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/litigation-costs.html#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%9Clitigation%20costs%E2%80%9D%20refers,sometimes%20time%2Dconsuming%20as%20well.\">litigation costs</a>.&nbsp; The cost can be low or steep, based on the complexity and duration of the case. If the outcome has an expected value higher than the lawyer’s fees and the time value of the client, these costs might be justified but may still be onerous.</p>\n<p>Once in motion, litigation takes its course, and the cost to turn it back and restore the parties to their previous state becomes counterproductive. Sometimes in due course, the outcome is lower than estimated costs, and the purpose of the litigation becomes burdensome. The ratio hence should be tilted towards higher outcomes than costs.</p>\n<h2>Input by lawyers and clients</h2>\n<h3>Lawyer</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A Preliminary Plan – One of the most crucial things is to lay down a probable road map at the very beginning. The room must be left for change in strategies due to the future turn of events, but without a road map, outcomes will not be aligned with the intended cost objective.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A road map should be in place even before a suit is filed because important strategic choices made at the start of a case result in better outcomes. Both the lawyer and their client should have a clear idea about the desired outcome and the cost attached to it.</p>\n<p>The lawyer should state whether it will be possible to achieve the goals set by the client under the budget put forward by them transparently. If the amount is too low, the lawyer may put forward a new budget with the necessary activities, the number of persons required, and the time needed for the whole process. The client may then negotiate and quote an amount acceptable by both.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternative options – A lawyer may approach their client with a choice of settlement as an alternative of going to court. When the client is not opposed to the idea, there still may be certain obstacles as to why the settlement should not be pursued at that particular stage. Also, even in the absence of cogent reasons for a settlement, the lawyer should at least come up with a structure so as to meet the outcome objective through settlement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Client</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Choice of the lawyer – The client should spend some time to choose a lawyer who has the expertise and is adept in the particular field of law. The case and the lawyer should be compatible for a better outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Clear communication – Most clients do not define expected outcomes, and even if they do, they do so without considering the cost. Hence, the lacuna formed makes the client have an unnecessary expectation and no idea about how expensive the process can be. If the lawyer lacks knowledge about the budget allocated, they may spend more than the basic necessities and result in the rise of costs. Hence, the client has to communicate openly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is the probable solution?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Outcome-based approach –The client has to decide whether they want a good settlement from the suitor to establish a precedent that will deter potential litigants. If the client wants to lay down a precedent, the lawyer needs to weigh in the case and identify the presence of a possible win, and should then go ahead. Otherwise, they should suggest alternate options.\n<ul>\n<li>Allocate Resources – After the client approves the estimated budget, the lawyer must make a detailed report concerning project requirements – Human resources, procedural costs, and other relevant aspects. The report should also state whether an expert of any kind needs to be brought in like a financial of technical expertise and the cost of the same.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Dispute Resolution – This scheme is way more cost-effective than lawsuits that require multiple court appearances and lengthy arguments. <a href=\"https://www.jessonrainslaw.com/news--blog/what-do-you-mean-theres-a-cheaper-alternative-to-litigation\">Mediation and arbitration</a> are two ways to solve a dispute out of court. In mediation, a neutral third party tries to negotiate a deal by going back and forth between parties. In arbitration, parties put forward evidence to a neutral third party who decides the fate of the case. It is less formal than a lawsuit and is less expensive too.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternative approach – Use of Technology</h2>\n<p>The client and the lawyer must agree to bring in useful technology to manage their case efficiently and make it easy to communicate and access information from both sides. Below is a case study of software created to manage legal cases better.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zola Suite</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://financesonline.com/top-20-legal-case-management-software-programs-small-medium-law-firms/\">Zola Suite</a> is a device to help judiciously manage legal cases. It is a cloud-based platform that offers email, efficient billing, and coherent legal accounting features. Advanced and high budget versions also provide an unlimited cloud space, which is good for bulk storage without the chance of losing important documents.</p>\n<p>The platform is user friendly and uses only a single series of log-in IDs, which is easy to manage. The data is stored centrally and can be accessed by the lawyers, their staff, and even the client. Their calendar feature helps organize activities involved in litigation and provides a clear timeline. One of the features enables us to track significant contacts for a particular case and also provides for automatic filing. This is a good example of how technology can help achieve efficient case management.</p>\n<h2>International presence</h2>\n<p>The United Kingdom has a plethora of case management software and companies like Thomas Reuter, that provides consultation to law firms to manage cases better. Firms in the USA also use legal software and special services, but instead of advice, case managers are assigned to particular cases. Singapore, on the other hand, has a robust <a href=\"https://www.elitigation.sg/_layouts/IELS/HomePage/Pages/Home.aspx\">eLitigation</a> system adopted by the court to help in the management of cases, filing of forms, and access to information.</p>\n<h2>Concluding remarks</h2>\n<p>The success of a case depends on the groundwork done at the outset of a legal dispute. When we make conscious choices and take important strategy decisions at the start, it results in an outcome that aligns with our objective.&nbsp; To achieve this, the client and lawyer have to work as a team and not take a typical approach but an approach best suited to the issue at hand and the needs of the client. They should communicate with each other in clear terms and try to settle the matter before moving the court. Lastly, technology should not be seen as a competition but should be used to optimise result.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author: </strong>Swarneeka. R.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p><strong>Legal community and technology</strong></p>\n<p>The legal community has aversed to technology mostly. While laptops have substituted typewriters, in the bigger scheme of things, this is minuscule or, at best, the legal community has witnessed a negligible change. &nbsp;The legal field has continued to operate in the manner as it has been doing in the past.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a gap exists between different legal communities in terms of technological presence in a developed country’s legal system than a developing county’s legal system. Also, there exists a technological gap in the legal system within a country. For example, in India, the New Delhi High Court is more technology-friendly than other state’s High Court.</p>\n<p>Both corporate and litigation sides of the legal field are witnessing tectonic shifts vis-à-vis technology. While corporate legal work is gradually adapting to technological changes like Artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, cloud computing, and others, the litigation side is gradually automating and technological changes such as Litigation management software, case management, online filing of cases, and other technological tools.</p>\n<p>The legal field has operated in a technology vacuum resulting in inefficient systems tackling legal issues. To illustrate, approximately <a href=\"https://thewire.in/law/pending-court-cases\">3.5 crore cases</a> are pending across courts in the Indian judicial system. Little has changed in the recent past, although the backlog has been persistent over a long period.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>\n<p>We introduce technology in any field to improve the process that exists in a particular field or change how elements in that field interact with each other. Stakeholders often look for innovating things since staying the same is regressing. The environment we interact with, digital or otherwise, is continuously evolving, and the processes need to adapt to the organic environment.</p>\n<p>Technology in the legal field has streamlined inefficient processes both for attorneys and organizations that have a legal department. On the other hand, technology has ensured that justice is just not a concept but something that masses can access.</p>\n<p><strong>The interplay between the legal community and technology</strong></p>\n<p>As technology continues to permeate the legal field, let us examine how and in what ways technology has impacted the legal community:</p>\n<p><strong>Litigation analytics</strong></p>\n<p>Litigation has largely been an unpredictable terrain where a case outcome can swing either way. However, we are observing legal technology firms developing analytic tools that can predict the outcome of a case with increased accuracy. For example, the launch of Context by Lexis Nexis has brought a predictable factor to litigation results. It analyzes the language of judgments of a particular judge and establishes arguments and cases that the respective judge will find convincing.</p>\n<p>One may be able to identify a pattern concerning the judge’s opinion and accordingly predict the outcome of their case.</p>\n<p><strong>Improved Legal research software</strong></p>\n<p>Legal research has been viewed as a protracted process since ploughing through dense texts and extracting relevant information can be a drawn-out process. However, legal research tools claim to use A.I (Artificial Intelligence) for analyzing the search keywords and display the most relevant search results.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Chatbots</strong></p>\n<p>Applications and Websites use chatbots to answer legal queries of users. Attorneys or humans do not answer these queries, but chatbots analyze the query, process it, and generate the answer automatically.&nbsp; However, this method has its limitations and needs a major overhaul before we can accept it as an integral part of the legal community.</p>\n<p><strong>Case management and Matter management</strong></p>\n<p>Case management has transformed from mere storage to analyzing the workflow of the organization or attorney and creating database accordingly. Further, it automatically schedules an appointment with the clients aligning with the attorney’s schedule, arranging the contact list, managing documents, and recording data for billing purposes. The information is centrally stored and can be accessed from anywhere.</p>\n<p>Matter management is broader in scope and entails several aspects of corporate legal practice. It allows the user to create and open a matter, assign attorneys and timekeepers to matters, and report on who worked on what matters and for how long, to name a few.&nbsp;Matter management creates a structure within an organization that ensures managing workflow in a better way, thereby leading to effectively managing resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart contracts/Blockchain Technology</strong></p>\n<p>Blockchain technology-based contracts are gaining popularity since they cannot be altered and can be accessed by all the parties. It ensures transparency and enforcing the rights of parties under the contract. Furthermore, these smart contracts are automatically executed, and records particular events aligning with the terms mentioned in the contract.</p>\n<p><strong>Litigation Management Software[LMS]</strong></p>\n<p>Attorneys use LMS to chart a litigation path where clients are updated with case developments and also costs associated with the process. It enables the client to weigh in factors like costs, among other things, and decide whether they want to initiate or continue with the case.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM)</strong></p>\n<p>Corporates are adopting CLM to manage their contracts effectively. CLM organizes each stage of contract management ranging from pre-executing to post-executing contracts.&nbsp; It ensures that the firm doesn’t miss the project deadlines, enforce their rights, electronically execute the contract, and other aspects.&nbsp; It also saves the firm from expending resources on low-value work like searching for documents or looking for files etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>We should not forget that technology is no magic bullet or panacea for the issues plaguing the legal field. Technology is just a facilitator of digital transformation but not the sole agent of change. Change in procedural laws, along with technology, will create a more significant impact rather than counting on technology only.</p>\n<p>Technology cannot eliminate the human element completely, and technology is a tool for collaborating among different facets of the legal field by helping break the silos. It’s the technology that has foregrounded the vital factor that is people cooperating among themselves- social skills- and not just skill to interpret the law. We cannot deny that jobs will be lost owing to computers.&nbsp; However, new job opportunities will be created, particularly in data analytics, legal design, and other tech-based domains.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>About the author : <em>Suryash Kumar, working at Vidma Consulting Group LLP, who loves exploring the uncharted territories.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\t<p>Globalisation and the opening of the domestic economies by the respective countries have been one of the greatest phenomena of the last few decades. The inclusion of foreign players in the domestic economies has led to a significant economic boost, especially for developing countries. In the year 1990, India, as part of its substantial economic reforms, has opened up its domestic market and liberalised trade practices in the country. Since then, the Indian economy has grown sharply, and a major contributor to this has been the service industry. In view of this, it is fascinating to observe that the Indian legal services market is still a well-regulated market and has refused to accept the changes brought in by liberalisation and globalisation.</p>\n<p>The Bar Council of India (BCI) has been reluctant in opening the Indian legal market to international law firms to protect the Indian legal professionals. They fear that it will hamper the prospects of Indian lawyers as they may not be able to compete with the specialised services that would be provided by the foreign firms. However, the demand for India’s legal market has been growing strongly with many foreign and multinational companies investing in India and many Indian companies entering into cross-border transactions with foreign companies. This has put constant pressure on the Indian authorities to open the legal market to international law firms.</p>\n<h2>2  International agreements and Indian Legislations</h2>\n<h3>2.1  <strong>General Agreement on Trade in Services</strong>:</h3>\n<p><strong>India being a member of WTO and a <a href=\"https://commerce.gov.in/writereaddata/trade/Consultation_document_on_the_WTO_negotiations.pdf\">signatory to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)</a> is under an obligation to liberalise and open its service sector to member countries. Consequently, the legal profession is also taken to be one of the services included under GATS.</strong></p>\n<h3>2.2  <strong>Indian Laws and Regulations</strong>:</h3>\n<p>Legal services in India are largely covered by the Advocates Act 1961, and the Bar Council Rules 1975. BCI is the main <a href=\"http://www.barcouncilofindia.org/about/about-the-bar-council-of-india/\">regulatory authority</a> for the legal profession. Various provisions for restrictive practices in the legal profession are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to section 24 of the Advocates Act, 1961, for a person to be eligible for enrollment as an Advocate, he must be a citizen of India, not less than 21 years of age and must have an LLB degree. Thus the act prohibits the foreign nationals from working as legal professionals in India. Moreover, international firms prefer to bring in experts and practitioners from various different countries.</li>\n<li>Also, a combined reading of <a href=\"http://www.barcouncilofindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Advocates-Act1961.pdf\">section 24, 29 and 33</a> of the Advocates Act, 1961 provides that only a natural person can practice law in India. This means that no legal service provider can be incorporated as a company and continue the legal practice in India.</li>\n<li>Section 47 provides for provisions relating to reciprocity; it stipulates that if any country prevents Indian citizens from practicing the profession of law or subjects them to unfair discrimination in that country, then no subject of that country shall be entitled to practice law in India.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, an Advocate in India cannot enter into a partnership or any other arrangement with a non-advocate. This restricts various foreign firms which provide all kind of services like accounting, taxation, etc. across different jurisdictions.</li>\n<li>Another restraint in this regard is Rule 36 of the BCI rules which restricts Indian firms to advertise their existence through any form of media. As most international firms have extensive advertisements and websites, this creates an imbalance between Indian and foreign firms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3  Need for Liberalisation of Indian legal market – Advantages and disadvantages</h2>\n<p>Historically, liberalisation and globalisation have been extremely beneficial for the Indian economy. Thus there exists a strong case for reciprocating the same in the legal service market as well.</p>\n<h3>3.1 Advantages of opening a legal market to International law firms</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, allowing International firms in the Indian market would lead to increased competition among legal practitioners. This competition would result in improved capacity and quality of services, thereby leading to the growth of the Indian legal market.</li>\n<li>This will also provide Indian lawyers with the opportunity to work with international fraternity and could lead to more employment opportunities with better pay and working conditions.</li>\n<li>Apart from the legal professionals, it would also benefit the clients as foreign firms would be willing to provide the best services at minimal costs to attract and build a client base in India. Moreover, for several services, travel costs would be reduced, which would ultimately reduce the cost of services.</li>\n<li>Since several Indian law firms have established offices in various jurisdictions outside India, it would only be fair to reciprocate the interest by allowing the foreign firms to practice in India.</li>\n<li>The specialised advisory from foreign firms is required in many cases such as cross border transactions or compliances relating to different jurisdictions. Since foreign firms possess expertise in some areas of law which are not so well developed in India, it would be the interest of all to allow these firms to provide direct service in such cases.</li>\n<li>With increased cross border deals and outsourcing activities involving both Indian and International clients, it is pertinent to allow both Indian and international firms to work together without restrictions.</li>\n<li>Allowing foreign firms in the Indian market would consequently have a positive impact on other sectors as well. This could provide more stability for international players to invest in India.</li>\n<li>Another benefit of allowing foreign firms would be increased professionalism in Indian law practices in comparison to their international counterparts.</li>\n<li>It is also provided that foreign firms in India won’t hamper the working of Indian lawyers who practice before the court of law in India. These foreign firms would mainly concentrate on corporate or commercial transactional work and avoid functioning as litigators before the court of law in India because of various factors such as language and cultural problems, a dearth of knowledge of the Indian legal system and also the absence of litigating experience in Indian courts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>3.2  </strong><strong>Disadvantages of opening legal market to International law firms-</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The biggest disadvantage associated with opening of Indian legal services market is the possibility of domestic law firms being overshadowed by their foreign counterparts in terms of performance and finances.</li>\n<li>Since the major foreign firms operate at an extensive level, they predominantly function as business organisations; they could easily swipe up the opportunities for the India legal professionals.</li>\n<li>These organisations with their size, power and influence may promote the commercial interest of their big-name clients affecting the judicial system.</li>\n<li>Another concern is the risk of <em>employability</em> of fresh graduates and young legal professionals. Since there is a noticeable gap in legal education and skills in India and some foreign countries, these foreign firms may be more willing to hire individuals from outside India.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4   Suggestions</h2>\n<p>To implement liberalisation in the Indian legal market, it is important to first try and put the Indian firms on an equal footing with their foreign counterparts to reduce any                 competitive disadvantage between the two. For this, a two-fold approach is required to be adopted according to the author. The first approach provides for opening of                 the legal market for foreign firms in a phased manner, and the second approach deals with the steps to upgrade the practice by Indian firms.</p>\n<h3><strong>4.1   </strong><strong>Phased Manner Approach</strong></h3>\n<p>The Indian Legal Markets can be opened in a three-phase manner:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the first phase, it is required to liberalise the Indian laws and regulations. The laws restricting the opening of the Indian legal market such as section 24, 29, 33 and 47 of the Advocate Act, 1961 needs to be amended to allow foreign nations to be able to practice in India. Various other rules by the BCI such as the restraint on advertising and limiting the number of partners, etc. need to be removed to encourage international firms to practice freely in India.</li>\n<li>In the second phase, the entry of foreign firms initially can be restricted by adopting various measures. These measures can include clearly defining the areas of law/ services which can be provided by the foreign firms, maintaining the ratio of foreign to Indian legal professionals in the Indian market and/or granting licences to foreign firms according to the specific market requirements.</li>\n<li>In the third phase, foreign firms can be allowed to expand their practices in India. This can be done by systematically removing the restrictions on their practice and also allowing them to form joint ventures in India. Harmony should be developed between the Indian firms and their foreign counterparts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>4.2   </strong><strong>Recommendations for India legal Practitioners</strong></h3>\n<p>There are various recommendations for Indian legal practitioners to better compete with International law firms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professionalism is one of the key factors for practising legal professional. As a part of Indian law firms are family-run organisations, they lack behind in maintaining the same level of professionalism. To develop and compete with foreign firms, Indian firms must improve in this regard.</li>\n<li>Indian firms should equip themselves with specialised skills as this will help them to differentiate themselves from their foreign counterparts.</li>\n<li>Indian firms may also merge with their Indian counterparts to balance the economies of scale with global firms. This can help them to compete with foreign firms on economic levels.</li>\n<li>Indian firms should also invest in developing soft skills and provide skill training to India law students to counter the skill set of international law firms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>India, unlike other common law countries, has not shown many positive signs for liberalising the Indian legal market. The BCI has opted for a protectionist approach due to the fear of the competition from the international law firms. This is based on the belief that the Indian practitioners will not be able to compete with foreign nationals on an equal footing. However, as discussed above, such competition is a welcome change for the overall growth of the Indian legal market. The liberalisation of the legal profession will have many-fold benefits for the industry player, including the clients themselves. The quality of services offered would improve, better career opportunities will be provided to law graduates, clients will have more options at competitive prices, and furthermore, the liberalisation of India legal market will also help India to achieve a global name in the legal profession.</p>\n<p>Thus with the ongoing wave of globalisation and liberalisation, it is imperative that the Indian legal profession move on from its protectionist stand and open its legal services market for foreign players. Instead of deliberating on the disadvantages of this approach, it is more sensible to develop and implement measures for the inclusion of foreign firms in the Indian in a systematic manner so that it does not lead to undue disadvantages to the Indian players. Today, the Indian legal profession is highly competitive and is ready to grow along with its foreign counterparts in a globalised world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author:</strong> Jalaj Agarwal is a final year student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\t<p>Our everyday lives move forward with the use of technology. The new and growing digital world is designed to make lives easy, better and solves our social problems. Although, it comes with its baggage of challenges and issues related to risks, security and privacy. Technology, with its growing developments, lacks immunity from devising any harm. Without any policies to overcome the issues faced in the digital world, malicious actors and cybercriminals only grow smarter and devious by each day.</p>\n<p>Digital infrastructure has infiltrated our lives, and it looks like it is here to stay. Our daily transactions and interactions mostly and growingly take place in the cyberspace. This, in turn, provides cybercriminals and hackers opportunities for criminal exploitation. Apart from being able to exploit the cyberspace, criminals are at low risks of being caught.</p>\n<p><strong>21<sup>st</sup> Century and the Digital World:</strong></p>\n<p>Technology today is only growing and is also made available to all. Everybody is only glued to their phones and have forgotten the days where people went on picnics or had an in-person conversation other than video calling or texting.</p>\n<p>It is long gone when digitization meant usage of computers to only surf for information. Today information can be passed and communicated via a small device without any difficulty. IT only keeps surprising with its ever-growing and marvellous inventions. IT inventions have reached various sectors to help improve their growth and sustainability. With the digitization and ongoing developments, it is only about time when everything that we do in our daily lives become digital.</p>\n<p><strong>Digitization in India:</strong></p>\n<p>Digital revolution 2019, is about development and influential impact on different societies and economies. Digitalization brought changes into the way information was passed on across various sectors of the globe. It helped widen the grounds for businesses from national markets to other international markets. The digital revolution in India has improved and shifted to even the rural areas, thereby increasing the digital using population. Since 2014, the Indian government has brought about various measures in bringing digitization. The government has taken up initiatives like e-payment, digital literacy, rural development, etc.</p>\n<p>By digitization, they intend to develop all sectors, for example, education, health, rural, agricultural, etc. The e-commerce industry is expanding with digitization. The investing sector can be open to more crowds. The improvement in the education sector aims to deliver education to the needy. Digitization also brought about online labour where people can take up online jobs, food delivery and e-commerce being the prime examples.</p>\n<p><strong> Emerging Threats in the Digital World:</strong></p>\n<p>Threats in the digital world today have only been increasing with the change in time. There were no policies to prevent the threats back when digitization took over, and there are no policies now, even with the immense growth in technology. As technology grows, hackers and cybercriminals also grow and only continue to threaten the digital world. Nowadays, hackers have become entrepreneurs by starting up businesses and working for the government as official cyber agents.</p>\n<p>Cybersecurity plays a critical role in the economy as we have become dependent on cyberspace in our daily lives. One of the main threats arose due to 'datafication' in the digital world. Any activity or information turned into data that can be processed, monitored and analyzed is a growing threat. Since data seems to be a crucial factor that helps today's businesses and even individuals, it is considered to be most important. For example, governments use data to define policies, plan strategies; scientists and researchers use it to advance in science; businesses use it to strategize to improve their business and also attract customers.</p>\n<p>Other threats imposed by digitization would involve the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is used to automate tasks that are involved in surveillance, including analyzing collected data and using manipulating video and facial recognition for deception.</p>\n<p>Few of the most common threats would be Identity theft, Infrastructure security, Terrorist attacks, etc. Identity theft involves stealing another individual's identity for their benefits. Infrastructure security is a concern to both government and private sectors. Hackers getting a hold on to digital security systems can misuse and even destroy the communication systems and even shut down businesses online. Terrorist attacks would require hackers and cybercriminals to develop false identities to divert the surveillances.</p>\n<p>It must also be considered that even employees can engage in theft of data within companies as they are the direct link in the security chain. Either they intentionally or unintentionally pose a threat to the companies' security. For example, they may leak sensitive data as they are directly in connection and have access to these data. On the other hand, many employees are not up to date with the new technology or techniques used by cybercriminals. And this lack of awareness may lead them to unintentionally pose a threat to sensitive data or the security of the company. They may inadvertently visit infected websites and click on unwanted links that may be a trap set up by hackers to get access to databases.</p>\n<p>Even though with all the threats in place, solutions are developed to combat these issues. But with the growing technology, old security systems don't help; instead, there is a need for more advanced security. Encryption was one approach to safety. But due to the increase in web traffic that is both legit and malicious, threats are becoming unidentifiable.</p>\n<p>Another security approach would include the Unified Threat Management (UTM) that involves hardware and software installations for multiple security and networking functions. Mid-sized or small companies mostly use this kind of security approach. But they have also proven to be ineffective with today's highly efficient cyber-attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks imposed by digital transformation:                                                        </strong></p>\n<p>Digital transformation can be complicated and comes with risks that must be considered. Risks may differ depending on the kind of businesses, stakeholders, and the type of technology that is deployed. Few areas of risks include technology risks, cyber risks, strategic risks and third-party risks.</p>\n<p>Technology risks may influence both systems and processes. The risks involve unauthorized intrusion in security systems. Third-party risks include vendors, suppliers, or contractors that impose risks within the organization without them knowing.</p>\n<p>It may seem that digital transformation itself looks risky. But, in today's world, digitization is only growing, and without it, organizations and individuals may seem to be at a great disadvantage. The risk may be difficult to manage, but with careful considerations and precautions, the risk may be reduced with a successful digital transformation.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Issues in the Digital World:</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned before, with the growing change in digital transformation, cybercriminals are also getting smarter with their attacks. Growing changes in the system may require cybersecurity to be in check at all times. Protection against cyber threats and security issues may require a proactive and continuous automated approach to cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>There can be a couple of things that can be used to reduce cyber-attacks on security. With the use of integrated cyber-security systems, it may help manage cyber-attacks.  Use of built-in security applications, incorporate automation into systems for monitoring threats, hacking, etc. can also be few examples. Staff members in an organization can be trained in the use of technology and its skills and threats. This training may help in preventing these threats and even minimize them.</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy Issues:</strong></p>\n<p>This is the time where digitalization is everywhere and is growing very fast. Digitization today requires us to be able to adjust to the changes that it brings to society.  Many risks and concerns arise. The biggest concern of them all is our privacy.</p>\n<p>Even with all the security options and programs created to protect us, invasion of privacy in the digital age is considered to be the more significant risk. The rise in popular social networks gives space for sharing personal information and data. Therefore, our personal information and data are exposed to various threats.</p>\n<p>One of the most vulnerable cases is identity theft. A person that has experienced a theft of their identity can suffer financial loss or have his reputation tarnished. It may even lead to emotional stress. Other vulnerabilities may include, credit cards stolen, hacking social media profiles, misuse of ID's, hacking emails, bank accounts, etc. with our lives inclining to digitization, even our biometric data is in danger. A click on a wrong link can start a series of unfortunate events in a persons' both professional and personal lives.</p>\n<p>From the information that is shared on social Media to words used in searches and websites visited, personal data can be analyzed. Each use of the internet such as information shared online, cookies collected in browser history, online transactions, registered mobile numbers, etc. can help generate personal information.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we don't realize the threats that the digital world may impose when we share our personal information or database on social media and networks. We have no control over how our personal information or data may be used. All we can do is to be aware of the risks that may arise and be careful with the information we provide online.</p>\n<p>There is also a thin line between what may be public information and private information. The sphere of information on the internet is unclear. Public information would mean that the data may be free for use by any individual or entity. Private information would require further authorization to use it. The users are never made clear on which information they provide would be public and private.</p>\n<p>In India, the Mumbai police established a social media lab that monitors and tracks user behaviours and activities. The lab does not require any authorization to monitor individuals and their behaviours. The individuals are not made aware of the same. The project claims to monitor and analyze only publicly available information. There is no guarantee as to what information they would monitor. Indian courts have not dealt with the question of whether social media content is public or private.</p>\n<p>In countries like USA, individuals contested the use of their tweets without permission. But courts in the USA ruled that tweets that are both private and public can be obtained by law enforcement with just a subpoena. The USA courts claim that since information is already shared to another entity, it is no longer private.</p>\n<p><strong>Policy for internet privacy in India:</strong></p>\n<p>At the moment, the policy for internet privacy in India is found in the Information Technology Act (ITA), 2000. The ITA provides provisions to safeguard online privacy and also dilute online privacy. Penalizing, hacking and fraud can be few examples of provisions that protect the privacy of the user. Provisions that serve to dilute user privacy speak to access by law enforcement to user's personal information. This information is stored by body corporate, by collecting and monitoring of internet traffic data and decryption of online communications.</p>\n<p>India does not have any proper legislation for privacy. Although gaps in the legislation in ITA only weaken the privacy of online users. There are certain questions and situations that are not addressed. For example, the evidentiary status of social media content, merging and sharing of data across databases, rights of individuals to request service providers to take down their content, etc.</p>\n<p>India has many discourses relating to privacy on various projects and topics. These discourses bring public awareness on privacy and the perception of public privacy and its concern.</p>\n<p>One of the discourses is the debate on the Unique Identification Project (UIP). Since 2009, the government of India has brought about an identity scheme called UID or Aadhaar. It applies to all residents in India. It provides individuals identity based on their fingerprint, iris scans and photographs. Although, it is claimed that the scheme may not have proper privacy safeguards. The project places individual privacy at risk. They do not take responsibility or security measures for storages of information and biometrics.</p>\n<p>A committee of experts chaired by Justice A.P Shah released a report of the Group of Experts on Privacy in October 2012. The report consists of recommendations on a framework for privacy legislation in India. The report gives prime privacy importance and considers it to be a fundamental right. The report defines nine principles that apply to all data controllers in both the public and private sectors. This is believed to ensure to harmonize privacy legislations among governments and organizations. It also ensures that the government and businesses will be held responsible for protecting privacy. The principles follow the global standards of EU, OECD and APEC principles on privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyber-defenses:</strong></p>\n<p>Cyber-defences are still in its working process, just like the policies and legislations for privacy and security issues in the digital world. Certain defences that foreign countries follow are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Department of Homeland Security: it is tasked to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.it may begin with identifying any possible threats and weaknesses. It requires tracking and intercepting any would-be terrorists.</li>\n<li>Law Enforcement: Such departments may rely on cyber-agents or specialists to analyze the evidence, profile cybercriminals and execute surveillance operations. The police departments are getting familiar with the criminal consequences posed by the digital world.</li>\n<li>Private Sector: They use digital encryption methods to handle the latest viruses and hacking methods. These must be updated continuously. Big businesses make use of cyber-crime agents or specialists who help in analyzing sensitive data or respond to when data is compromised.</li>\n<li>The National Incident Management System (NIMS): It was developed by the Department of Homeland Security in connection with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). They work as a digital communications tool that ensures that all government agencies work in response to any natural or man-made emergencies.</li>\n<li>Public safety: Public can be saved from the threats of the digital world by depending on the ones that can respond to emergencies and terrorist attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>Privacy and security issues are the most important emerging issues in India's internet society. Companies will keep collecting information from online users and the government will continue to seek greater access and surveillance capabilities. It is only about time that India prioritizes privacy and focuses on implementing strong safeguards to protect Indian's and foreigner's privacy. This can be done by enactment of privacy legislations where privacy is considered a fundamental right. Inspiration can be taken from the small steps taken by the Report of the Group of Experts on Privacy and the government's draft on privacy bill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author : </strong>Daniya Rasheed believes in consistently growing and learning.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><u>ADR in Singapore</u></strong></p>\n<p>From the early 1990s, the Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanism has had a long-standing lineage in Singapore. The access to it since then has improved significantly; parties have resorted to alternatives to court litigation with ease and are actively supported to do so. Asia, in general, has been a significant contributor to the Arbitration industry, the number of cases handled by Singapore has explicitly increased by many folds. Singapore today is a crucial contributor to the arbitration industry in Asia.</p>\n<p>The Singapore government has taken many proactive steps to promote ADR in recent years. It has introduced various schemes and initiatives to encourage Dispute Resolution over legal proceedings. Its growth can also be credited to the judicial philosophy prevailing in the region, which supports dispute resolution as a good alternative. The main modes of Dispute resolution that have driven the Singapore judicial mechanism are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arbitration</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Arbitration industry has had a spectacular tenure in Singapore and continues to remain Asia's biggest Arbitration Centre. The growth is attributable to two things, the judicial philosophy prevailing in the country of <em>Parallel </em>and <em>Complimentary </em>adjudication and the rapid increase in the number of disputes in the region The fundamental reason why arbitration is a popular choice amongst disputed parties is the minimum intervention requirement. However, Singapore has always been a supporter of Pro-arbitration and not Pro-arbitral tribunal or awards which means that even though parties opt for a public process of dispute settlement, they still rely on the domestic legal framework to ensure legal bendiness.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mediation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taking inspiration from the US and Europe in the 1970s and 1980s, in 1992, mediation was introduced in Singapore. Where on the one hand, arbitration was an adjudicatory process, mediation was a more of a method of a rule imposing and sharing a sense of perspective to build a relationship. From the early 1990s, mediation has remained prevalent in Singapore. Currently, there are three broad categories of mediation processes: court-based mediation, community-based mediation and private mediation. Mediation has always remained distinctive because its focus has been to reach consensus rather than competing for individual interest.</p>\n<p>Court based mediation was introduced first to resolve any civil matters in courts. Adding mediation at an initial level before parties could take strong opposing positions would reduce the economic burden and dispose of cases quickly. Around the same time, Community-based mediation was then introduced by establishing Community Mediation Centres where matters which were family-related or neighbourly could be resolved within the community. Community-based mediation was considered to be fast and inexpensive. Additionally, private mediation is also a viable option for parties having high commercial stakes in place.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hybrid Methods</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A mix of Arbitration and Mediation is another process for dispute resolution. The International Arbitration Act under section 16 and 17 allows a mediator to act as an arbitrator, given that parties consent to it. This hybrid concept has been prevalent in many ADR Centers across the globe; however, it has not gathered popularity due to its low level of adoption.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Neutral Evaluation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apart from arbitration and mediation, neutral evaluation is a process of getting a non-binding determination of legal rights of disputing parties by the Primary Dispute Resolution Centre. The process entails hearing of the matter before a judge, who would give a non-binding evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the case. The parties then, based on the evaluation themselves assess their position and negotiate a settlement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>LSAS Arbitration</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Subordinate Courts Practice Direction Amendment No. 2 of 2012 has prescribed another mode of arbitration in Singapore, i.e. LSAS Arbitration. As per this form of arbitration, in contrast to other modes, the resulting determinant of the legal rights of disputing parties is binding in nature. Unlike Neutral Evaluation, a third party is robed in as the adjudicator instead of a judge. LSAS Arbitration applies to all kinds of civil suits and is a cost-efficient alternative. LSAS is especially beneficial for parties wanting to settle disputes of claims lesser than $60,000.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scheme Specific Dispute Resolution</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Considering the roaring success of ADR in Singapore, many organizations have started their sector-specific Dispute resolution mechanisms. These include the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore, World Intellectual Property Organisation for arbitration and Mediation (WIPO), Eagles Mediation and Counselling Centre, the Consumer Association of Singapore Mediation Centre and many others.</p>\n<p><strong><u>The Current trend and Future of ADR in Singapore</u></strong></p>\n<p>Current trends in Singapore indicate that ADR has been a successful mechanism as it has significantly reduced litigation costs, saved time and has reduced legal fees. Many reports have suggested that ADR services have resulted in the early settlement of cases through the PDRC.</p>\n<p>By 2019, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), the leading arbitration institute saw a record-breaking number of cases filed for arbitration. A large chunk of these cases was from India, the Philippines and Brunei. SIAC as of today is one of the World's most popular arbitration centers. The growth of SIAC as a global dispute resolution hub has fueled the government to introduce a new bill for the creation of an international mediation center in Singapore.</p>\n<p>The new Bill passed on February 4<sup>th</sup> 2020, is an international treaty on mediation, addressing the need for effective cross-border mediation settlement. The treaty enforces the establishment of an International Mediation Center In Singapore for easy settlement of cross-border disputes. The enforcement of this Bill seems promising, as it will elevate the effectiveness of mediation mechanisms and at the same time, attract businesses to choose Singapore to resolve international commercial disputes. The Bill also promises the parties the right to apply in different Singapore Courts to enforce/invoke any international settlement agreement preceded in a Singapore Court. Enforcing and invoking can be done against a party from another country if the requirements of Bill are fulfilled.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>\n<p>Businesses today recognize Singapore as the top destination for dispute resolution in the Asia Pacific. Singapore is consistently ranked amongst the top 10 in the least corrupt countries index and the only Asian country within the top 10. Singapore thus seems a viable option for businesses to resolves disputes. Further, the country's judicial system has its root in English law and is well established. Singapore's Ideal location also makes it's an attractive basis for businesses to settle.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the recent legislative developments such as the above mentioned Singapore Convention on mediation 2020 and the United Nations announcement to enforce a multilateral Singapore Convention on Mediation, expected to come on floors this September is hopeful and will give businesses more options to resolve disputes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong>: Mehak Jaswal is currently pursuing a degree in BBA LLB (Hons) from Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\t<p>Intellectual Property Rights are essential assets for the growth and development of any economy. They refer to the legal right granted to the creations that have arisen from the intellect of a human. These rights are granted in order to encourage creativity and innovation by ensuring that the creators reap the benefits of the inventions or <a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20110217_RL34292_168793a939c8d257384aa5f814dcda774c368542.pdf\">works</a>. IPRs are classified into numerous kinds such as copyrights, patents, trademarks, geographical indications, design etc. The globalisation of economic activities and expansion of international transactions which involve knowledge-intensive programs have focused a lot on this area. This has led to a high degree of protection of this area by the nations at a worldwide <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1244&amp;context=djcil\">level</a>. Keeping this in mind, IPRs play a massive role in taking decisions for FDIs. The existence of a pro-competitive business environment is of the utmost importance when it comes to FDIs. It is urged that FDI and licensing tend to benefit the recipient country and it is essential that such flows result in stronger competition on markets, promoting long term <a href=\"https://www.iatp.org/sites/default/files/Intellectual_Property_Rights_and_Foreign_Direc.htm#:~:text=And%20as%20noted%20above%2C%20IPRs,that%20matters%20overall%20for%20FDI.\">gains</a>.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>IPR PRACTICES IN INDIA AND CHINA</h3>\n<p>China has always been criticised for having weak IPR Protections, which is now beginning to change due to external pressure and internal economic objectives. Despite there being an existence of strong laws and to protect IPR, the Chinese are unable to embrace these entirely as they focus more on short term gain. This is probably because the country views the practice of having a more stringent IPR as potentially compromising on its economic production and <a href=\"nera.com/content/dam/nera/publications/archive1/PUB_IPR_Protection_China_IP1138.pdf\">consumption</a>. There might be instances of corruption and local protectionism that come in the way of proper enforcement. Additionally, limited or insufficient resources, as well as trainign available to enforcement officials regarding the impacts of IPR violations, can hamper enforcement of IP <a href=\"nera.com/content/dam/nera/publications/archive1/PUB_IPR_Protection_China_IP1138.pdf\">laws</a>.</p>\n<p>India is also considered to have inadequate IPR regulations, as mentioned in the Priority Watch List. The office of United States Trade Representative (USTR) annually prepares a Special 301 report which identifies countries that have inadequate intellectual property rights protection and fair market access to US entities relying on its protection. The Government of India has time and again dismissed the suggestions offered by the US to enhance its IPR regulations. However, this remains one of the biggest hurdles when it comes to entering into bilateral agreements with countries like the USA. The main concerns that arise are due to inadequate trade secret protection, online piracy, domestic distribution and export of counterfeit <a href=\"https://qrius.com/bilateral-trade-india-us-ipr-issues-remain-unresolved/\">pharmaceuticals</a>. The fact that India refuses to strengthen its IPR regulations could negatively impact the economy of the country and reduce its chances of being party to several agreements.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>IMPORTANCE OF INVESTMENT IN IPR</h3>\n<p>A lot of developments have been made in the realm of Intellectual Property Rights wherein countries are taking an active effort to adopt a set of minimum standards on IPR. This is done by signing the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) by the developing countries that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The strengthening of IPR protection is beneficial in the manner that it would have an impact on the innovation and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in these developing countries. FDI has become an essential aspect and is an important source of private external finance in developing countries. It is primarily motivated by the long term prospects of the investors to make profits in production activities directly controlled by <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1999/03/mallampa.htm#:~:text=FDI%20has%20become%20an%20important,activities%20that%20they%20directly%20control.\">them</a>. This helps in improving firms access to markets for goods and services and increases competition in markets that were previously protected by forcing firms to seek new markets, resources and assets abroad. IP is a significant asset and is important for the development of advanced industries that require a lot of research and innovation. However, strong IPR practices are not adequate incentives for companies and individuals to invest in a <a href=\"https://www.iatp.org/sites/default/files/Intellectual_Property_Rights_and_Foreign_Direc.htm#:~:text=And%20as%20noted%20above%2C%20IPRs,that%20matters%20overall%20for%20FDI.\">country</a>. IPs are included in the investment agreements as it increases the value of the investment and the IP could be subject to the general guarantees given to the investors. It can further lead to providing a legal basis to foreign investors for a cause of action against the host country for failing to protect their IP.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3> Foreign direct investment and bilateral trade agreements</h3>\n<p>Foreign Direct Investment or FDI is essentially an investment in the form of controlling ownership which is made from a party or entity in one country into the business of another country. This leads to not only the inflow of money but also knowledge, skills, competition, superior technology, market access abroad and bridging of foreign exchange gaps in the country where the investment is being made. It is considered to be an essential aspect of the development of any country and is a catalyst for the economic growth of the host country. Various factors come into play while making investment decisions, and they include the new technologies, specific organisational skills, reputation for quality etc. Additionally, certain other factors include location advantages by the foreign company, which makes it more profitable to locate the business abroad. Another reason would be the profitability of firms to internalise production instead of selling or licensing their intellectual assets to independent local firms in foreign companies. The investment in IPR protects the exporting firms from being limited to the local markets and thus, increase the market size facing exporters and inducing them to expand their sales. Additional market power is granted to such firms, and the countries with stronger IPR protection tend to attract more <a href=\"https://www.iatp.org/sites/default/files/Intellectual_Property_Rights_and_Foreign_Direc.htm#:~:text=And%20as%20noted%20above%2C%20IPRs,that%20matters%20overall%20for%20FDI.\">imports</a>.</p>\n<p>Free trade agreements are agreements between two or more nations that allow unrestricted purchase and sale of goods and services between the parties without the imposition of certain constraints. These agreements can either be bilateral or multilateral. Bilateral Trade Agreements are necessarily agreements between two nations which confers favoured trading status between the two nations. This is done by giving access by both to each other's markets, and this leads to an increase in the trade and economic growth of a country. When it comes to Intellectual Property Rights, these agreements are made to agree that neither of the nations will steal the other's innovative products. They tend to adopt each other's copyright and other intellectual property laws. <a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33205.html\">When</a> a country enters into a trade agreement with another country, the signatories are obligated to amend their intellectual property laws to match or resemble those of the more developed country.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>RELATIONSHIP OF FDI and BTA WITH IPR</h3>\n<p>A lot of confusion exists regarding the influence of IPR on foreign investment. This confusion pertains to whether strong protection of the IPR of a country has a positive or negative impact on foreign investment in a country. The reason for a positive impact is that the risk of copying or imitating the IP would be less and this would lead to a higher demand for protected products. Conversely, the negative impact would be that a strong IP protection would provide the holder of the right with immense market power. This might lead to the firms to divest in the country and get their services from other foreign countries. Also, if there are higher levels of protection, the investors may choose to switch the mode of delivery that is preferred from foreign production to licensing. Thus, there is a lot of ambiguity in the effects of a higher level of protection of IPR on investment. However, on average, stronger IPR protection policies have a stronger tendency to induce higher inwards flow of <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1244&amp;context=djcil\">FDI</a>.</p>\n<p>The relationship between IPR and Trade is not entirely simple but is rather complex, and it is not mandatory to include IP in Trade. The main aim of Intellectual Property Rights is to protect the creations of the human intellect, which are essential in our day to day lives and also help in maintaining growth and development. Trade, on the other hand, is related to exchanging goods and services subsequent to the intellectual creation process and is primarily done to satisfy needs and distribute the resources efficiently in national and international <a href=\"https://www.bilaterals.org/?the-impact-of-free-trade\">markets</a>. The functions of these two might coincide as the objective of free trade is to move goods and services across borders without barriers. However, intellectual property laws have complex rules when it comes to parallel importation, exhaustion of rights and doctrines of infringement. These rules are helpful for the owners of the rights as they can then restrict the movement of goods. While IPR focuses on maintaining a monopoly, for proper investment to occur, some competition needs to subsist. Thus, it can be seen that stronger IPR protection tends to be manipulative as it creates a new form of protectionism under the idea of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>IPR AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS</h3>\n<p>Technology Transfer plays a crucial role in the growth of any country. Technology can be <a href=\"https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/ecidc2012_bp6.pdf\">defined</a> as \"the information necessary to achieve a certain production outcome from a particular means of combining or processing selected inputs.\" Comprehensively, the definition of technology is not only limited to equipment. It also includes the transfer of skills, knowledge to operate, use and maintain as well as understand the technology hardware to make it <a href=\"https://www.twn.my/title2/IPR/pdf/ipr14.pdf\">possible</a> to innovate independently in the future. Technology transfer refers to the activity of one party, gaining access to the knowledge of another party and becomes able to adapt the knowledge successfully in the specific process of production. This becomes important so that local people, farmers, firms and governments can make and design technologies which can, later on, be helpful in the growth of our economy. There are many barriers linked with the transfer of technology and these include poor infrastructure, inadequate laws and regulations, lack of absorptive capacity, shortage of skilled personnel, lack of finance, ignorance of technological issues, high cost of certain agreements, problems created by suppliers of equipment and intellectual property rights. While these barriers are subjective, there are certain central problems while transferring to developing countries. These include the fact that there has been a liberalisation of the economy, which means the technology can be directly exported without resorting to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or licensing, the licensing technologies would assist a licensee in becoming a potential competitor in the global market, and for licensing to become a viable option, the expected return should yield more than the transaction costs and risks paid by the licensor.</p>\n<p>It is often seen that the availability of an effective IPR protection regime provides foreign companies with an incentive to transfer the technologies that are protected to developing countries. This, in turn, increases the inflow of FDI, thereby bringing about technology transfer to the host country. However, there is no clear cut evidence that strengthened IPRs will result in direct FDI. In certain situations, a strong IPR protection can make the situation more problematic, and a weakened IP regime can facilitate access to foreign technologies. This can be seen as India has the most US Food and Drug Administration- approved manufacturing facilities outside the US, which is a testament of the superior technology and quality standards achieved by Indian manufacturers when the IP protection was low.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Intellectual Property Rights and investment have a complicated relationship which is yet to be appropriately uncovered. Most of the theories that revolve around their interactions are statistics-based, and there is very little theoretical knowledge pertaining to this that exists. IPR has a very strong future, and this is a pivotal time for its future. It is essential for the countries, especially developing countries, to come up with strategic policies to promote the economic objectives of intellectual property. These policies must align with the International standards and the TRIPS Agreement and should be made in a way that further the objectives of the international trade scheme. When dealing with IPR, Trade and investments, it is always beneficial to ensure that there is effective competition. In order to further the interests of free trade agreements with respect to IPR, it is essential to combat high levels of intellectual property piracy overseas, support research and development and establish a more suitable balance of trade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author:</strong> Ankita Sethi a fourth year law student from Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\t<p>In the legal field, the digital space has given birth to plenty of electronic agreements between several overseas businesses. However, some issues occur in the execution of such e-agreements. These issues could be with regards to the mental state of the party and his competence to enter into a contract. Since e- contracts take place online, it becomes difficult for the parties to determine whether such e-contracts would be enforceable or voidable.</p>\n<p>Though this digital space gives way for the development of technology, it also carries with it several impediments in digital contracts, digital signatures and other legal issues.</p>\n<p>There are certain ways to curb these legal impediments which can ensure the parties do not suffer when they enter into such agreements.</p>\n<p>A digital contract or e-contract is made in an electronic form where the paper or printed copies are not utilised. When an online contract is sent via email or other modes of communication, the contract is acknowledged by the <a href=\"https://acadpubl.eu/hub/2018-120-5/4/377.pdf\">client</a> by way of an electronic mark.</p>\n<p>This electronic mark could amount to a digital signature which completes the agreement making it a contract.</p>\n<p>Such electronic contracts are like a Terms and Conditions agreement where the client clicks the option of “I agree” to enforce the agreement.</p>\n<p>Offer and acceptance are two important factors which ensure the execution of a contract. A contract is executed when the one party accepts the offer made by the other party. Therefore, to ascertain whether an online contract is valid, one must determine the origination and communication of such offer.</p>\n<p>Once it is accepted, the mode in which such acceptance took place, must also be identified. It is of vital importance that such <em>offer</em> and <em>acceptance</em> in an online contract is carried out in a systematic manner. Since contracts mostly depend upon offer and acceptance, such procedure must be done systematically to enforce the contract.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>E-CONTRACT LAWS IN INDIA</li>\n<li>Information Technology Act, 2000</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Section 10-A of the Act expressly lays down that electronic contracts are valid and enforceable. Executing parties can also store such agreements in electronic form. They would be considered as an electronic record under the Act.</p>\n<p>Both digital contracts and e-signatures are recognised under this Act. Section 5 of the Act, deals with legal recognition on digital signatures, making it binding and valid.</p>\n<p>With the growing change in technology, a need for introducing new laws was necessary. These agreements which could be entered into electronically could be carried out through different modes of communication. Some modes are via email, fax or the <a href=\"http://vinodkothari.com/2019/10/validity-of-e-agreement-and-e-signature/#_ftn2\">Internet</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Indian Contract Act, 1872</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All contracts, including electronic contracts, are valid and governed by the Contract Act. Section 10 of the Act lays down which agreements amount to contracts. This also includes electronic contracts as stated under the Information Technology Act.</p>\n<p>A valid e-contract entered into between two parties must be governed based on the provisions prescribed in the Act. The contract must be entered with free consent and for lawful <a href=\"https://www.mondaq.com/india/contracts-and-commercial-law/699022/validity-of-electronic-contracts-in-india\">consideration</a>.</p>\n<p>In Clickwrap agreements where the user clicks the “I Agree” option with regards to the Terms and Conditions would be bound by that contract. This is because the user was made an offer, and by clicking the “I Agree” option, he agrees to the agreement, which then becomes a binding contract. Such person shall be then obligated under that contract and such contract would be held as a valid one.  The contract shall obligate such person, and the law considers such contract as valid.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Indian Evidence Act, 1872</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The courts in India recognise electronic contracts as evidence under the Evidence Act. The Act states that e-agreements have the same effect as any paper-based agreement and are also legally valid.</p>\n<p>The definition of evidence includes electronic records which shall be admissible as evidence in the court of law. Section 65-A recognises the evidentiary value of digital contracts. Also, the procedure to furnish such contracts as evidence is provided under Section 65-B of the <a href=\"https://www.mondaq.com/india/contracts-and-commercial-law/699022/validity-of-electronic-contracts-in-india\">Act</a>.</p>\n<p>The opinion of the Certifying Authority, which issues the Electronic Signature must be taken into consideration by the court as a relevant fact. This must be done when the court has to form an opinion of an electronic signature and its validity.</p>\n<p>The intention of the parties and the various steps required to ensure the agreement becomes a valid contract is necessary to be taken into consideration. Such electronic agreements must, therefore, comply with the provisions of the Contract Act, 1972 to amount to a legally enforceable contract.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://14.139.60.114:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/722/9/Online%20Contracts.pdf\">LEGAL ISSUES AND REMEDIES PERTAINING TO DIGITAL CONTRACTS</a></li>\n<li>Capacity of Parties</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When either party agrees, the key factor to be considered is the capacity of the parties. According to the Contract Act, a person of unsound mind, a minor, lunatic, or an intoxicated person is incompetent to enter into a contract.</p>\n<p>One important issue in executing online contracts is that the competence of either party is mostly always unknown to the other party. Since the parties are not physically present in the process of an online contract, it becomes difficult to ascertain whether they are competent or not.</p>\n<p>Today, many minors pose as adults on the Internet and enter into online contracts from anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p>In order to curb this wrongfulness, the law must provide for some verification process with regards to their age to determine competence.</p>\n<p>The parties should be allowed to include a clause where they shall be barred from repudiating the contract to determine competence. This clause would make the certain parties bound by the contract and be obligated not to raise any objection in the later stages of the contract. A minor however, if enters into such contract, would make the contract void or invalid.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of Consent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In cases of lack of consent, a contract can be unenforceable either due to mistake, misrepresentation or fraud. A mistake could be a mistake of law and mistake of fact. A mistake of law does not amount to a valid excuse to avoid contractual obligations. The only exception would be the mistake of foreign law. The issue that arises is that many trans-border transactions take place online. However, the parties are not entirely acquainted with the laws of both countries. It, therefore, raises important questions as to the enforceability of the contract.</p>\n<p>Another issue which could arise is the determination of the rights and liabilities of the buyer and seller. For instance, a buyer contracts to buy goods from the seller wherein such goods are prohibited in the buyer’s country. In such cases, a serious concern as to mistake of law occurs.</p>\n<p>A mistake of fact is very high in online transactions as well as in the complexities involved in those contracts. In the mistake of facts, “absence of consent” plea can be made available to the parties.</p>\n<p>Apart from the mistake, a contract can also be avoided on the grounds of misrepresentation. In a brick and mortar store, the buyer can physically ensure the quality of a product and would make the seller liable for any defects in the product. However, in online purchases, the buyer stands at a disadvantage towards ensuring the quality of the product. Therefore, innocent and fraudulent misrepresentation come into picture in an online transaction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click-wrap Contracts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Online registration can either be the registration of a user for using a particular software or registration of a user into a Website offering specific services. In some cases, companies provide their software’s online, which can be downloaded by the user. The license of that software can then be granted online to the registered user.</p>\n<p>When software is licensed terms and conditions package is attached to it. When the package is opened the user is deemed to have read the terms and conditions. This would make him bound by the contract. Such contracts are called shrink-wrap licenses. However, in the case of online licensing, the problem that occurs is in the making of the terms and conditions as no physical delivery of software is carried out.</p>\n<p>Click-wrap agreements are those where the Terms and Conditions of a particular agreement must be visible on the website. Once the user clicks on the “I Agree” button, it is deemed that he has read the agreement and has accepted the offer.</p>\n<p>The Terms and Conditions on the website must be conspicuously visible to the user. If such user is not given a chance to read them reasonably, then the terms are not binding on the user.</p>\n<p>For an online contract to be a valid one, all the essential ingredients must be present. An online contract is as valid as a traditional one. There are certain advantages which arise from online contracts as compared to traditional contracts. They are faster, more efficient and can reach cross-borders without the physical presence of both parties. It is easier and convenient, and with proper certainty, it can be executed.</p>\n<p>If the essential ingredients of the contract are fulfilled, then these online contracts can be seen more in e-commerce transactions. To ensure that the e-commerce flourishes, the formation of the online contract is extremely crucial before any online transaction is finalised. The terms and conditions must be visible to the other party. They must be made in a proper manner without any misrepresentation or fraud. Therefore, all the necessary statutory provisions must also be observed and complied with.</p>\n<p>Once the parties have complied with the relevant applicable laws, online contracts provide diverse opportunities for any e-commerce business. Therefore, such digital contracts act as a key influence to uplift the future of e-commerce.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author: </strong>Sameera Singal is currently an undergraduate student pursuing law at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\t<p><strong>The ‘Coronavirus’ Pandemic</strong></p>\n<p>In January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of Coronavirus as a Public Health Emergency.  It has created debilitating effects in the whole world, as much as in India. The Indian Healthcare system, Economy, Geo-Political scenario, MSME Sector, Migrants and labours are wretched, and in a deplorable condition and about the same, the government and the authorities are doing an outstanding job in handling the crisis as better as possible.</p>\n<p>At the same time, this outbreak has taken a toll, not only on people's lives and physical health but also cast multiple consequences on their mental health. This disease has led to uncertain changes in living pattern, daily routine, financial setting and social life. There is a lot of misinformation and rumour spreading around, which can make a person feel unclear and not in control of their own lives. This has become stressful for people around the world. There is a sense of fear and anxiety, which is a result of overwhelming emotions and precariousness.</p>\n<p>Public health actions, such as social distancing, can make people feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety. However, these actions are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Therefore, <strong>coping with mental effects in a healthy way can help people sail through these debilitating times and rise stronger collectively.</strong> During the COVID-19 pandemic, one can experience stress, anxiety, fear, sadness and loneliness, and mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, can worsen. In the light of the same, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/mental-health-considerations.pdf?sfvrsn=6d3578af_2\">World Health Organization</a> has released advice on <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/mental-health-considerations.pdf\">protecting mental health during the coronavirus outbreak</a>, which is universally lauded.</p>\n<h3>The effect of Covid-19 on Mental Health</h3>\n<p>The world has faced several other epidemics and outbreaks such as SARS and MERS. But the present Coronavirus is unprecedented. The rapid spread has spawned strain on the ability of the nations to keep their economies afloat. It further reveals the reality of the healthcare infrastructure and treatment accessibility in various countries.Continuous concerns and discussions are surrounding the physical health, but it is crucial to assess the real impact of COVID-19 on mental health and then to analyze and adopt strategies to mitigate its effect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/index.htm\">Mental health</a> is an important part of overall health and wellbeing. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It may also affect our ability to handle stress, make choices, and our action during a health emergency. The pandemic can significantly affect mental health for everyone, but especially for those with mental illness. Both the anxiety of contracting the disease as well as the increase in loneliness and isolation can worsen and trigger symptoms. Acknowledging, recognizing and acting on mental distress in these uncertain times is key to lessening the impact. Some of the major symptoms which one should look out for are:</p>\n<p>-Anxiety</p>\n<p>-Contamination Obsessions</p>\n<p>-Loneliness</p>\n<p>-Traumatic Stress</p>\n<p>Furthermore, social isolation is related to numerous symptoms. Due to the past experiences of the epidemics, it is known that such outbreaks can elicit anxiety and anticipation of possible infection, which sometimes manifests itself as health anxiety. This can get a person to become exaggeratedly preoccupied with one's health and a continuous body vigilance, which may create various mistaken beliefs about their health. These can persist and evolve into more intense symptoms such as anxiety and panic attacks. Misleading information from news outlets and social media can exacerbate restlessness. The headlines about the new infection rate and the death toll are persisting, which can re-affirm that the condition is spreading at an exponential rate. This potentially increases anxiety and depressive disorders and worsens matters for people restrained in their homes.</p>\n<p>We are now aware that it is a community ordeal. Now, it is upon us to undertake measures which will aid in diminishing uneasiness in day-to-day life, or consider reaching out to a psychotherapist that can help ameliorate the unnecessary paranoia. It also should involve journalists, as they should endeavour to be progressively exact on their reports and maintain a strategic distance from click-baiting.  Besides, policymakers have the chance to show that science and technology will advance their choices and decisions in health policies. At the point when one of these instruments are not acting solidly during the pandemic, subjects who already have a mental disease are the ones most susceptible to the worsening of their illness. <strong>While staying up to date and informed about the coronavirus pandemic and the latest public health measures is important, it's also essential to look after self and others around.</strong></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>Ways to mitigate its effects</strong></h3>\n<p>It is important to acknowledge the mental effects and to be aware of the ways one can become capable of mitigating the negative effects of this pandemic. Some of them are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social media and news updates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reading good quality information is crucial in such times when there are constant updates about infections and death tolls, and lots of rumours and false news is spreading around. Therefore, it is important to read reliable information e.g., <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WHO</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NHS website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CDC</a>, avoid speculation, take a regular break from social media, limit media exposure, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stay Connected</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Staying connected can prove to be healing while going through quarantine measures and self-isolation.  Stay in touch with family and friends can help boost mental health and feel associated. Use digital platforms like Skype, Facetime, email, messenger and text, etc. Meanwhile, focus on positive thoughts and try to accept the changes and keep the perspective in place.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The terms' self-isolation', 'social distancing' and 'quarantine' have been used quite interchangeably. For example, people may refer to putting themselves into self-isolation, when they mean that they are practicing social distancing and others might use the phrase quarantine to describe their situation when self-isolation or social distancing is more accurate. It's important to understand the differences between the terminology they use and the affect it can have on those around them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A difference in atmosphere when staying or working at home</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As working from home is being incentivized, with it accompanies a whole plethora of thoughts and emotions, as people are uncertain as to when they will return to their 'normal' working routine. It can be dealt with, by sticking to a routine, establishing boundaries, taking frequent breaks, setting small goals, supporting team members, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find Things to Do/Distraction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Find activities that can be distracting from current events such as household chores, online courses, streaming movies and tv programmes, setting priorities and reasonable goals each day and outline steps to reach those goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take Care of Yourself, Avoid burnout</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is essential to find ways to take care of self and create a regular routine, but avoid burnout at the same time. The critical self-care activities are sleep, physical exercise and a healthy diet. If a person feels stressful, find a way to let out such as journaling, going for walks or talking to people. It helps in maintain a sense of normality and reduce stress. It is important to practice mindfulness and not think of the future or worst-case scenarios.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People with Pre-Existing Mental Conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People with pre-existing mental health conditions or substance use disorders may be particularly vulnerable in an emergency. Conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia affect a person's thinking, feeling, mood or behavior in a way that influences their ability to relate to others and function each day. People with preexisting mental health conditions should continue with their treatment and be aware of new or worsening symptoms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get help when needed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People may suffer through mental health effects and not do anything about it and continue to suffer. One must not hope that such issues will wane on their own, which can lead to more worsening symptoms. It is better to ask for help, and be upfront about it. While experiencing such issues, one should contact a close friend or loved one, contact employee assistance program, if available, and get counseling or ask for a referral to a mental health professional. Further, in case of feeling suicidal or seeking help, contact organizations such as the <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/Home\">National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/\">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)</a> for help and guidance.</p>\n<p>The above-mentioned are some ways a person can keep a check on their mental health and keep it at its best during these distressing times. Simultaneously, the authorities in charge of the healthcare infrastructure and the healthcare stakeholders should also undertake some measures in order to aid the population to deal with the mental effects imposed by the pandemic. Some of them are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strengthen community prevention</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The authorities should provide counseling support to individuals and families directly affected by COVID-19, including individuals who lose their jobs, healthcare and essential workers, older adults, people with disabilities, and individuals experiencing extended quarantine. Outreach programmes should be conducted across the communities in order to promote resilience, quell the stigma, and create a platform where people can reach out for help.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leverage data and technology</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Initially, the predictive analytics must be used to direct prevention and clinical resources to those most at-risk for mental health or substance use problems and unmet basic needs. Moving towards recovery, the use of artificial intelligence must be promoted, improve the data sources, and digital platforms to connect the people seamlessly to the medical care. The government should also consider wide approach to invest and fund tele health structure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate behavioral and physical health services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The communities should be made aware of the behavioural health as much as a part of the overall health of a person. It will further aid in reducing the stigma attached to the disease. There should be universal screening and treatment for mental health and substance use problems in healthcare settings, including for individuals at high risk of getting the virus. There should be investment in increasing behavioral health proficiency of primary care providers, and employing peer counselors to enable timely behavioral healthcare, and strengthen capacity of the behavioral health workforce.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Address unemployment and income disparities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Economic disparity leading to financial strife and unemployment, may prove to be one of the major factors in affecting mental health of a person. To reduce the long-term effects of the same, policy makers and employers should find innovative ways to accelerate skill redevelopment, job redeployment, supported employment, and incentivize investments in local job growth. Moreover, the employers should stick to the regular employee wellbeing measures such as paid sick leave, childcare facilities, and healthcare provisions.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Looking at the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak, it can be said that it is not going away anytime soon. The current strong feelings and overwhelming emotions may fade away slowly, but its effects on the mental state can continue to loom. The pandemic might subside but it is going to leave various reverberations which would last for a long while. It is pertinent to continue self-care practices and strive to increase the ability to cope with life's ongoing challenges. The anxiety, stress, financial discord, grief, and general uncertainty of this time will undoubtedly lead to behavioural health crises. Therefore, it is pivotal to advocate for an increased focus on mental health during the coronavirus pandemic, and also highlight the urgent need of augmenting the focus on resilience. This will make people better and efficient to cope with the stresses and effects on mental health imposed by the Covid-19 outbreak, both at individual and societal level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong>: Samiksha Agarwal hails from Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Introduction to Data Privacy</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Privacy has forever been a crucial aspect of the human being and one of the reasons we are considered individuals. In our private lives, we form opinions and have different experiences that distinguish us. These are the events that are personal to us, and if these were known to the world, we would have been nothing but an open book. With the advent of the digital world and more information being shared online, we are an open book being published for free.</p>\n<p>Data Privacy explains how a piece of information must be managed based on its relative significance. It is considered similar to putting locks on our filing cabinets or safety deposit boxes in the bank because it denotes a sense of security. In practical terms, data privacy is a branch of data security that is concerned with the proper handling of data so that it does not reach the wrong hands.</p>\n<p>Today, Data is the most important asset to any company, and they must do everything in their power to protect it. Data privacy is not just a business concern, as it may harm an individual far more as the risks are multi-faceted. Bruce Schneier, an American Crytographer, could not have put it better when he said, “Data is the pollution problem of the digital age and protecting privacy is the environmental challenge.”</p>\n<p>Data could range from anything like the financials of a company or the opinions of an individual, but the concept of data privacy is principally applied to personal information which usually includes biometrics, financial data medical records and even social security numbers. A data breach at a corporation could put proprietary data in the hands of a competitor. In a similar way a leak at a hospital could put the medical records in the hands of those who may misuse it.</p>\n<p>In this digital era, consumers have been using social media and e-commerce sites daily. These apps have been generating vital information through consumer usage that may be stored. This Data is being collected by websites and browsers to form a pattern and observe consumer behaviour.  Information leaked from a breach could be insightful for various reasons. In fact, it could be so insightful that it could change the world. That is what happened in March 2018 when ripples were created around the world after the Cambridge Analytica controversy.</p>\n<p><strong>Cambridge Analytica controversy</strong></p>\n<p>This data privacy scandal centres around a strategic consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and the social media giant Facebook. Between 2014 to 2017 personal information of approximately <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/facebook-data-privacy-scandal-a-cheat-sheet/\">87 million people</a> was harvested from Facebook by Cambridge Analytica. This Data was to be used for political advertising and was the most significant know leak in Facebook history.</p>\n<p>Facebook has had numerous data breaches due to its inadequate and insufficient measures to protect the data, but a leak of this magnitude was not unprecedented. Cambridge Analytica was able to harvest personally identifiable information through a personality quiz app called “thisisyourdigitallife”. The information gathered from the app was useful in building a “psychographic” profile of all the users so that they could be categorized to understand behaviour.</p>\n<p>Researchers associated with the programme stated that they could automatically and accurately predict highly personal traits of an individual. This included but was not limited to ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, political and religious views. The quiz gave the creator the application access to find profile information and user history of the individual. It also gave them access to all the user’s friends which gave them more data to munch on.</p>\n<p>So how did profile information of an individual give the model information like political views, and even if it did how was it useful? The model helped form a relationship with a given attribute, for instance, combination likes such as “Juicy Couture” and “Adam Lambert” were likes indicative of gay. Similarly, likes such as “WWE” were indicators of a straight man. This is how, through likes and dislikes, millions of individuals were categorized for political benefits.</p>\n<p>Cambridge Analytica sought to sell the data of American voters to political figures aiding the presidential campaigns of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. It was reported that Ted Cruz paid approximately <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal\">six million dollars</a> in services to the company. The Data was then used to create tailored advertisement so no matter what the views of an individual were, Ted Cruz looked like the right man. It may not have completely worked for Ted Cruz, but with Donald Trump the story was quite different.</p>\n<p>Trump utilized the data to build profiles to which different messages were displayed. Advertisements were segmented into different categories, based on whether the individuals were Trump supporters or potential swing votes. Swing voters were shown negative ideas about his opponent, Hilary Clinton and in the long run, this worked in his favour, as his campaign was remarkably successful. The services of Cambridge Analytica were also allegedly used during Brexit in the United Kingdom and a host of other countries for smaller elections including India.</p>\n<p>When this information came to light in 2018, there was a severe backlash, mostly faced by Facebook, as users of the social media website were worried about their Privacy. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg apologized for this ‘mistake’ and agreed it was a breach of trust. The reaction was so severe that a movement was started to boycott Facebook altogether and their stock drastically fell as user rates dropped.</p>\n<p>A new campaign of “#ownyourdata” was started making people aware of the repercussions of data breaches to the world in general. The founder of this campaign, Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, set up a foundation, which promoted digital intelligence education. Programmes like hers are a necessity as everybody realizes the value of data and how it can be misused.</p>\n<p>Government Intervention was severe as well with a U.S Court ruling that Facebook knew of Cambridge Analytica’s improper conduct months before they were publicly reported. Later, Facebook was fined <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2019/07/24/facebook-pay-record-5-billion-fine-u-s-privacy-violations/1812499001/\">five billion dollars</a> to settle the investigation as it was apparent, they were involved in the illegal activities. Other government including Brazil, United Kingdom and India demanded further investigation into the matter as they believed there was more in the shadows.</p>\n<p>The impact that this controversy brought was huge in every aspect. It helped decide elections and changed the course of history, but at the same time, it helped create awareness around the world about the significance of Data Privacy. The layman began to comprehend the repercussions of a data breach and how it may affect him. Even governments and private organizations realized that it was essential to set up a rigid framework of regulations with severe penalties on non-compliance. However, with the compliances adapting, it was inevitable the breaches were evolving.</p>\n<p><strong>Way Forward</strong></p>\n<p>The last few years have shown us that Privacy on the internet is a true oxymoron. Data breaches are frequent occurrences, cyber-surveillance is something that everyone is wary off, but data privacy regulation is still in nascent stages.</p>\n<p>All over the world, governments have been striving to establish regulations and compliances that would ease data privacy. Countries such as South Korea and Japan that enjoy high-speed internet have stringent penalties for companies that are not able to protect their user’s data. Other states like the USA and China regularly prosecute and convict individual hackers for data breaches.</p>\n<p>Legislations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the Data Care Act in the USA have been advocating for change in this digital world. These laws have been revolutionary and helped developing countries understand the necessity of setting up a framework protecting data.</p>\n<p><strong>GDPR MODEL</strong></p>\n<p>The GDPR has been the torchbearer of the data protection movement as it has given every country skeleton legislation to work on, according to their needs. This law does not just apply to the European Union but also those dealing with EU citizens. Some of its key features are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specific Permission – Unless an app or a website gets the specific approval to use the consumer’s details, it will not be able to do so.</li>\n<li>Data Portability – This is a right given to every consumer to ask for the data that a company has about them in a readable format.</li>\n<li>Right to be forgotten – The information that a company obtains from a consumer cannot be kept forever. This data has a right to be forgotten and consumers could ask companies to delete it if required.</li>\n<li>Limits on the use of profiling – This provision was absolutely required as it would hamper another Cambridge Analytic controversy from occurring. Under the GDPR, Profiling can be allowed only if the person consents to the same or where it is permitted by the law. Adopting Techniques – The new law promotes techniques such as anonymization and encryption so that messages are encoded and can be read only by authorized personnel.</li>\n<li>Duty to report breach – Organizations are bound to report a data breach within 72 hours since it occurred. If the breach is likely to result in a high risk of adversely affecting individuals’ rights and freedoms, organizations must also inform those individuals without undue delay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hence, the legislation set up regulations that have given individuals a sense of security by making the process transparent. Similarly, companies have benefitted as the law is a one-stop solution making business easier.</p>\n<p>In India, targeted breaches like the WhatsApp snooping incident are rare and unprecedented. We did not see data protection regulation with seriousness until the Cambridge Analytica incident.</p>\n<p><strong>INDIA EMULATING GDPR</strong></p>\n<p>After the GDPR came into being, India was heavily inspired and took steps to safeguard its citizen’s rights and their digital data. The Supreme Court passed a landmark judgment on Privacy which paved the way for the draft Data Protection Bill 2018 submitted by a ten-member committee.</p>\n<p>The preamble of the Bill mentions ‘Data privacy is a fundamental right of every citizen’. This philosophy must be inculcated in our laws so that people can gain the trust of its State. The Bill goes on to charter a well-thought-out framework, covering various notions but is still to be passed as it sits in joint committee discussion.</p>\n<p>Some of the provisions empanelled by the Bill could be very helpful as these would definitely reduce data leaks. The Bill has placed large emphasis on citizen’s privacy and included all the important provisions of the GDPR. India has also categorized data into three classes, namely sensitive data, critical data and general data. All the sensitive and critical data must be stored on local servers. In fact, critical data cannot be taken out of the country at all.</p>\n<p>India has gone one step further as compared to the EU in ensuring its citizens the data privacy it deserves. Through such legislation, we are witnessing some quantum security solutions, but the industry is yet to hit an inflection point. There are a host of challenges being faced as data can flow from one country to another and then be breached. The problem here would be we would not know which legislation to adhere to.</p>\n<p>It has been a couple of years since the GDPR has come into the formulation. Companies have found certain loopholes in the regulations like setting up complicated terms of service. These conditions have the user accepting his data being shared without even realizing it, as it is disguised in complicated language.  Another problem being faced is that the penalties for non-compliance are not stringent enough and may not act as a deterrent.</p>\n<p>If data privacy is truly a fundamental human right, consumers must know how their Data is being used. For this to occur, it is important that corporations realize their moral responsibility to consumers and the intrinsic core value of Privacy. The safeguarding of citizen’s Data needs to be both a combination of technology and policy-based solutions, and only then will Privacy on the internet be taken seriously.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>About the author: </strong>Vidur Ujjwala is a 5th-year student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

All sports events have either been <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/coronavirus-sporting-events-affected-outbreak-200310084205890.html\">postponed or cancelled</a>. For instance, Euro 2020 tournaments have been postponed until 2021, and the 2020 Wimbledon tennis Championships were cancelled. Among the most significant global sports event Tokyo 2020 Olympics and the&nbsp;Indian Premier League T20 tournament have been cancelled.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Impact on revenue and athletes</strong></p>\n<p>There are three primary income streams for sports leagues: broadcasting (sales of media rights), commercial (sponsorship and advertising partnerships) and match day revenue (ticketing and hospitality). If sporting events are cancelled, this will result in a huge decline in the revenue and even loss of jobs. Broadcasters are now banking on reruns, like Star Sports lined the streaming of “50 of the greatest IPL matches” from March 29 2020. The <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/ipl/why-bcci-postponed-ipl-calling-off-the-league-would-have-cost-rs-3000cr-6313469/\">cancellation of the IPL</a> will cost the BCCI, the tournament’s broadcasters, and the franchises&nbsp;at least Rs 3,000 crore.&nbsp;On-air advertisers are looking to seek refunds for advances paid if not a single game is played.</p>\n<p>Similarly, event sponsors, on-ground sponsors, and on-ground vendors may choose to terminate their contracts or consider renegotiating them. These on-ground sponsors also have to bear the loss of beverage and catering partnerships, which are reviewing the<em> force majeure</em> clause and considering suspension of payments. For instance, the IPL 2020 edition already generated an estimated Rs.600 crore and Rs.500 crore from on-ground sponsors and team sponsorships, respectively. All this, in turn, would impact the overall GDP of India as well.</p>\n<p>Although some reassurance has been given to the athletes by the Sports Ministry that athletes will be given their allowances with no cut downs. As the Budget Division has asked the ministries not to spend the entire portion of their budget, Sports ministry is likely to halt its infrastructure projects, but training-and competition expenditure would not be hit. Moreover, the Government has issued an <a href=\"https://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/Central_Government_Update.pdf\">advisory</a> to employers to refrain from terminating jobs of football players or from reducing their wages.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sports infrastructure used as Quarantine Centres</strong></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, sports are drawing nearer to the forefronts of the plague, as many athletic facilities and stadiums across the globe are being <a href=\"https://time.com/5813442/coronavirus-stadiums-hospitals/\">converted to temporary hospitals</a> or isolation wards. The strategy was first undertaken by China, followed by Australia and Brazil. In India, the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and the BCCI declared that they would be willing to turn all cricket and sports stadiums across the country into quarantine facilities. Sports facilities can administer numerous patients at once, freeing up other workers to focus on the most extreme cases. Trucks and buses can easily move people and supplies in and out of the facilities, and the arenas come equipped with the massive electrical capacity to keep a hospital going. The Conversion of <a href=\"https://thebridge.in/latest/coronavirus-how-sports-stadium-howrah-converted-quarantine-centre-overnight/\">Howrah’s indoor Dumurjala Stadium</a> into a 150-bed quarantine center, the Gachibowli stadium in Telangana, used as a quarantine center for passengers coming into India, are some instances.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How has COVID reshaped the Sports discourse Panglobal?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no iota of doubt that once the world recovers from COVID-19, sporting events will be welcomed back with open arms. However, there is a pressing need to take critical measures and plan for future challenges. Some areas which we will explore are:</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Resuming non-contact sports</strong>:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Non-contact sports are already imbibed with some sort of social-distancing, especially badminton or tennis. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) suggested non-contact sports such as badminton, and cricket, tennis, etc. can <a href=\"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/other-sports/ficci-non-contact-sports-stadiums-empty-sanitisation-lockdown-eases-covid-19-sport-resumpton/article31574925.ece\">be resumed with a reduced workforce</a>. Also, ensuring stadiums are sanitized. Even the SAI has already allowed opening up of Sports Complexes in SAI training centers while conveying the message “<a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/others/khelo-india-phir-se-sai-releases-sop-for-resumption-of-sports-activities/articleshow/75868053.cms\">Khelo India-Phir</a>”. If international borders are opened up, it will lead to complications of mass testing. But, national events can very well be opened up as a first step in reviving the sports industry. India is planning to commence training for such sports, especially for athletes stuck in SAI hostels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Virtual Fans:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>“I play for the fans; that’s what it’s all about,”&nbsp;LeBron James, an NBA basketball player said.&nbsp; “If I show up to the arena and there ain’t no fans there, I ain’t playing.” But with the virus not going away anytime soon, sports played in empty stadiums with virtual fans are going to be a reality soon.</p>\n<p>Sports authorities must focus on improving the viewing experience for the fans. The Indian Premier League is getting inspired by the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/09/football/bundesliga-borussia-monchengladbach-fans-cutout-spt-intl/index.html\">Bundesliga’s creative idea</a> of introducing virtual fans where mannequins were put up with faces of people who had bought the tickets in the stadium. The fans were then sent a match program, and they were able to see their photo too, which enhances their watching experience.</p>\n<p>Various organizations offer technology, including augmented reality products, which could add cloud noise and the impression of a group to broadcasts. Moreover, even players need to hear their fans to boost their morale and enhance their performance. This can be achieved using audio elements triggered by at-home fans so that players can hear virtual fans cheering remotely. As Michael Conely. Vice President of Digital has rightly said, “If technology is done right, there are no boundaries as to where it goes.”, this is the time to explore and experiment as even if stadiums are opened up, people might be reluctant to go.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3) E-sports: </strong></p>\n<p>With the world in ‘lockdown,’ 2020 may well end up being the launchpad e-sports needed since the traditional games come to a halt. eSports describes the world of competitive, organized video gaming. Popular games include Call of Duty, Counter Strike, Fortnite, etc. Looking at the economic angle, the player can livestream e-sport to make money, while the publisher/owner of the game earns through a number of downloads. E-sports very well promote social distancing too; hence, it is a win-win situation. Strikingly, WHO, which characterizes ‘video-gaming’ and ‘computerized gaming’ as a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/gaming-disorder\">disorder</a>, is currently supporting the #PlayApartTogether initiative to encourage social distancing.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are only two major international esports governing bodies: the International Esports Federation (the “<strong>IeSF</strong>”) and the World Esports Association (“<strong>WESA</strong>”). However, governing bodies in esports cannot impose rules that fundamentally alter the mechanics of a game, and the power is held exclusively by the publishers.</p>\n<p>Recently, NASCAR made its e-debut with the eNASCAR iRacing&nbsp;Pro Invitational Series Race. It had the real NASCAR drivers&nbsp;in simulation mode. Even India organized an <a href=\"https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/third-international-online-shooting-championship-100-shooters/\">International Shooting Championship</a> on May 9, 2020, wherein each shooter was given an electronic target setup, which streamed the action and their scores while they shot. Started as an alternative outlet, it can turn into a full-time competition.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Judiciary and Sports Law</strong></p>\n<p>The above changes can only be incorporated in the industry if they are aided by law.</p>\n<p>In <strong><em>K. Murugan v. Fencing Association of India, Jabalpur</em></strong><a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, the Supreme Court has discussed the importance of law by commenting: “Sports in modern times have been considered to be a matter of great importance to the community. International Sports has assumed greater importance and has been in focus for over a few decades.” Despite this, the Indian Judiciary’s contribution to developing sports jurisprudence has been very negligible. The Courts are reluctant to adjudicate upon a sports issue. This is because Indian Courts do not possess the technical knowledge and the judges are not experts about the rules and nuances of a particular sport. An ideal solution can be the establishment of a sports tribunal with experts as sitting judges in addition to judicial judges.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There has always been a necessity for a comprehensive codified system of sports law. In light of the rapidly gaining popularity of e-sports, especially in the wake of COVID-19, issues like legal betting, IP protection of publishers, e-contracts, etc. need to be addressed. In January 2019, the Sports (Online Gaming and Prevention of Fraud) <a href=\"https://www.firstpost.com/tech/gaming/shashi-tharoor-moves-sports-bill-to-regulate-online-gaming-and-prevention-of-fraud-5905041.html\">Bill</a> was introduced in the Lok Sabha by Mr. Shashi Tharoor to give a legal framework for guaranteeing that business is run smoothly with no illicit practice. The purpose of the bill is two-fold: 1) It recognizes sports fraud as an offence and lays down a special procedure to deal with the same. 2) It provides for the regulation of online sports betting activities due to the ever-growing commercial nature of sports.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some other potential domains where legal intervention is required are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> a) Recognition of players:</strong> Professional e-sports players should be recognised as athletes, for them to avail benefits and protections that are ensured to traditional players. Certain bodies are dedicated to the protection of the interests of traditional sports player but there is no such body to promote interests of eSports players. Additionally, Government usually provides special sports quota in jobs to ensure a steady income. For example, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2012/07/18/156959417/athletes-in-india-work-part-time-government-jobs\">Sandeep Sejwal</a>, who competed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics works for the Indian Railways. These opportunities should be given to eSports player alike.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>b) Regulating Body: </strong>Presently, India comes up short on a regulatory body for eSports like the Board of Control for Cricket in India for cricket or other bodies such as Sports Law and Welfare Association of India, SAI, etc. There is a need for a federation for performing functions which advance and develop eSports like the United States eSports Federation. In spite of the fact that the <a href=\"http://esportsfederation.in/\">Esports Federation of India (EFSI)</a> was established in 2016, it is yet to be recognised by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and the Indian Olympic Association. This is regardless of the fact that it has already been recognised by the International e-Sports Federation and the Asian Electronic Sports Federation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition to this, bringing the subject of sports under the Concurrent list will enable creation of an autonomous and wide-ranging national sports regulator, along the lines of SEBI. The regulator could be entrusted with overseeing elections and even establishing a permanent sports tribunal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>c) Using unfair means, Match fixing, Betting: </strong>Esports are unique in relation to traditional sports, and thus, the methods of cheating are novel and exceptional too. In 2018, a player from the Counter-Strike: <a href=\"https://tecsense.knocksense.com/news/optic-indias-nikhil-forsaken-kumawat-busted-for-cheating-during-cs-go-finals\">Global Offensive Group of OpTic India was caught</a> using “aimbot” software which makes sure that the bullets are never missed at the LAN competition. The player was initially banned for 2 years which was later reduced to 6 months. Traditional Sports have stringent penalties in case a person is found cheating. For example, if an Olympic athlete tests positive for drugs, he is removed from the competition for at least two years with recently awarded medal stripped of him.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/2018/09/05/276th-law-commission-report-on-legal-framework-gambling-and-sports-betting-including-in-cricket-in-india/\">267th Report</a> of the Law Commission of India has emphasized on regulating gambling and sports betting due to the rapid increase in online gambling.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> If betting is regulated in India it will help to monitor the conduct of the bookies also mitigate the risk of corrupting players who are lured into match fixing and spot fixing due to the huge money involved in the business.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> d) Contracts: </strong>Generally, eSports don’t have government involvement as the teams are owned by private players, and competitions are held by mostly the publishers of games, which are again private parties. Players of eSports being young often fall prey to these big individuals and end up entering into contracts which invariably <a href=\"http://rsrr.in/2019/07/05/regulating-e-sports-an-opportunity-and-a-challenge/\">take away some necessary rights</a>. For instance, not long ago, during the preparation of Asian games, players were made to sign contracts that imposed harsh conditions, like waiving off organizational obligations of the ESFI. A governing body must ensure that the interests of both parties are protected by prescribing minimum standards that need to be complied with while drafting these contracts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> e) Establishment of Sports Commission: </strong>A national legislation on sports must be enacted under which a Sports Commission should be established. This Commission should advise the Sports Ministries regarding sports, ensure adequate allocation of funds and oversee implementation of policies. It should have investigative powers and be made accountable for the funds collected by sports federations which too should be made autonomous and should be registered under the national legislation instead of the Societies Registration Act. Even control of organization like SAI can be given to the Commission.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION </strong></p>\n<p>Endeavor ought to be made to improve the sporting environment with the aid of the law. Sport is not restricted to entertainment alone but involves National pride. The pandemic has come on hard and fast. From multiple points of view, when sporting events came to a halt, a significant part of life changed so rapidly and extensively that it stunned numerous into seeing the extent of the problem. Resumption of play, however long it takes, will give fans and players alike an assurance that we are on our way to beating the pandemic.</p>\n<p>We look forward to the day when teams once again take the field, and the sports business becomes cheerful as before with the changes that must be incorporated with all precautionary measures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> 1991 SCR (1) 658</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The Law Commission of India, Two Hundred and Seventy Six Report on ‘Gambling and Sports Betting including in cricket in India (2018)’.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong> :</p>\n<p>Tisha Chhaparia is an undergraduate student pursuing BBA LLB(Hons) at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\t\n<p><strong>Why are employees hired</strong>?</p>\n<p>What if I tell you the Boeing Founder(Probably dead) built what Boeing is today all by himself. Either you would think that I have gone crazy or be naïve to believe the story. In a perfect world, we can expect remarkable stories, such as stated earlier. However, the reality is contrasting to what I have mentioned. Boeing is an aviation giant. And the people who worked or are working with Boeing are one of the factors propelling Boeing to the revered position which it today sits upon. An organization cannot go far without a talented and diligent workforce. We know a firm cannot expand in a human resource vacuum.</p>\n<p>But, it will be oversimplifying things if we see human resources only needed for expanding a firm's business.</p>\n<p>A firm grows because of the ideas. People bring innovative ideas that drive the firm towards its objectives and helps it to tide over the ebbs and flows of the business environment. Ideas have their root in ingenuity, which is one of the many abilities that human beings possess. And this ability helps find answers to challenging business questions. Therefore, the unique abilities that human beings have, ingenuity being one of them, necessitates the hiring of people by the firm.</p>\n<p>Although the organizations are ramping up deployment of software and artificial intelligence at various levels of their business operations, there will always be room for human resources in an organization.</p>\n<p>We can also examine the decision to hire from an economic perspective. According to an article published on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2011/09/03/why-do-companies-hire/#4afdf5e751bb\">Forbes</a>, Companies hire \"when profits missed from not hiring exceed the cost of adding a new worker\", and this makes sense as organizations function on a cost-benefit basis.&nbsp; There are economic factors, the value that human beings bring to the organization, and several factors that contribute to a firm's hiring decision.</p>\n<p>Since now, we understand why firms hire; the next section will discuss how or what's the procedure to hire employees?</p>\n<p><strong>What's the procedure to hire</strong>?</p>\n<p>Firms may hire through references or advertise the opening in their organization on websites or job search portals. The later route consumes more resources. Besides, well-established organizations visit colleges and offer jobs to final year students of that respective educational institution what is called campus recruitment.</p>\n<p>Whichever route a firm takes for hiring, the employment contract forms the cornerstone that defines interaction/relationship between the organization and the recruitee.</p>\n<p><strong>Kinds of employment contract</strong></p>\n<p>Permanent Employment contract: For an employee, this is the sought-after contract, but organizations view this as an onerous contract, and they are not wrong in branding this form of engagement as burdensome. A permanent contract entails many statutory obligations for the organization vis-à-vis the employee. These contracts are perpetual and end only on termination by either party involved in the respective agreement.</p>\n<p>Fixed-term contract: Yes, you guessed it right. Contracts belonging to this category are valid only for a specific term stated in the respective contract.&nbsp; After the stated term is completed, the contract automatically terminates. In most scenarios, the benefits under a Fixed Term Employment contract correspond to benefits offered in a Permanent Employment contract.</p>\n<p>Casual Employment contract: When the employer is not sure about job parameters such as working hours or a regular working pattern does not apply to the job. Employers in the situation mentioned above hire through Casual employment contracts. As the term casualness suggests, there is an element of casualness associated with the job. Usually, a minimum weekly working hour is prescribed, and the working hours are dynamic. The benefits depend significantly upon the number of working hours the person has clocked.</p>\n<p><strong>Different stakeholders</strong></p>\n<p>There are divergence and convergence of interests if we examine the Employment contract from the perspective of different stakeholders, i.e. government, organization, and employees.</p>\n<p>Pan globally, states have transformed from a labour-oriented to a capitalist-oriented regime in a bid to attract manufacturers for setting up their manufacturing units in their countries. Although this may have increased foreign investments in the host country, the labour rights have taken a backseat.</p>\n<p>While wage rates have been a major irritant in the employee-employer relationship, the government has enacted labour regulations for preventing exploitation of the employees by the employer. However, the ground reality is starkly different. Contractors continue to exploit the labourers taking advantage of their ignorance, and the complicity of the labour authorities aggravate the situation. There are several issues apart from the above stated, such as working conditions, timings, maternity benefit, and other chokepoints that exist at the workplace.</p>\n<p><strong>The shaping of legal discourse lately related to employee laws</strong></p>\n<p>In the past decade, along with the earlier mentioned workplace problems, new complications have arisen. For instance, moonlighting, gig worker issues, sexual harassment at the workplace, gender discrimination at the workplace, women subjected to glass ceiling treatment in organizations, confidentiality, non-compete clauses, etc. A firm must be wary of the legal implications that may emerge because it fails to comply with the applicable laws.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-compete clause</strong>: The clause ensures an employee doesn't join the firm's competitors during the term of the employment contract. If a recruitee has voluntarily executed the employment contract, the individual must act within the contours of the agreement. Although firms should understand, including clauses that are wide and sweeping or skewed towards the firm will be considered void by the court of law.&nbsp; For instance, an extended term of the employment contract usually is interpreted by the courts as unreasonable, and employees are permitted to join the firm's competitors.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-solicitation clause</strong>: prevents an employee from co-opting the firm's other employees or its clients for their benefit. The limitation exists during and after the term of employment. Co-opting can be in the form of future business deals, providing services to clients, etc. &nbsp;Like with the non-compete clauses, non-solicitation clauses should impose reasonable restrictions. Factors such as duration, prohibiting the usage of trade secrets and goodwill determine whether a restriction is reasonable or unreasonable.</p>\n<p><strong>Confidentiality or Non-disclosure of trade secrets</strong>: Organizations are circumspect about their trade secrets or confidential information getting divulged or their competitors getting wind of such information. Employers ensure that the employment contract incorporates non-disclosure clauses deterring employees from making illegal disclosures.</p>\n<p><strong>Probation</strong>: An employee is not on probation unless stated in the employment contract. If a firm doesn't include a probation clause in the contract, It is assumed that the employee joins permanently. Probation period enables the firm to observe the skills of the recruitee, and only confirm their employment when they fit in the demands of the job.</p>\n<p>The legal implications of joining the firm as a probationary and permanently are starkly different. The probationary period is less onerous for the firm in terms of dismissing the employee from service, remuneration and other aspects. The firm must be clear on the fact whether it wants to hire employees on probation or confirm them as permanent after probation.</p>\n<p><strong>Training Bonds: </strong>&nbsp;ensure that the employer recovers the resources expended on the employee if the employee chooses to sever from the organization before the employment contract period.&nbsp; Resources expended may be in the form of training imparted to the employee and other skill enhancement program. The amount sought under training bonds should be reasonable; otherwise, the courts declare or reduce the amount demanded from employees in the context of training bonds.</p>\n<p><strong>Termination for cause</strong>: It outlines the conditions or situations wherein the employees will be terminated from the service.&nbsp; Stealing, lying, failing a drug or alcohol test, falsifying records, embezzlement, insubordination, fraud,&nbsp; misconduct, disclosing private, confidential information or trade secrets, and other unacceptable behaviour of the employees. The firm must state the conditions in the employment contract that will lead to termination for a cause unambiguously.</p>\n<p><strong>Other compliance requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Special laws also require organizations to comply with specific stipulations to safeguard the interest of the vulnerable. For instance, Laws have been enacted for the prevention of sexual harassment of women at organizations. Non-compliant organizations have severe legal implications ranging from hefty penalties to imprisonment to those responsible within the organization for failing to comply with the relevant law.</p>\n<p>There are other laws which prevent discrimination among employees based on gender, race and other similar attributes. The discrimination manifests in the form of difference in salaries, employees hitting a glass ceiling and similar patterns observed at the workplace.&nbsp; To an extent, laws like <a href=\"https://taxguru.in/company-law/woman-director-independent-director-company-law-regime.html#:~:text=Second%20proviso%20to%20sub-section,woman%20\">Companies act, 2013</a>, break the glass ceiling by warranting at least one woman director on the boards of companies.</p>\n<p><strong>How can we help</strong></p>\n<p>Our team at Vidma is proficient in drafting employment contracts. We understand the firm's objectives and align the content of the agreement with it. As highlighted above, employment agreements if not drafted diligently, can turn the employees of an organization into a liability rather than an asset. The holistic approach that we take integrates the client's interest with the legal obligations of the client.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, employee laws are dynamic, and We ensure that our clients stay ahead of the legal development curve by providing them with information relating to developments in the employment laws.</p>\n\n\n<p>About the author : <em>Suryash Kumar, working at Vidma Consulting Group LLP, who loves exploring the uncharted territories.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\t<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1 id=\"Healthimpactfund\">1.     <a href=\"https://healthimpactfund.org/en/\">The health impact fund</a></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Health Impact Fund is mainly intended to provide access to expensive medicines to needy patients at an affordable cost. States and charitable foundations finance this Fund. It systematically offers rewards to those pharmaceutical innovators. They register their product with the Fund to receive annual payments.</p>\n<p>These registered products with the Fund are then delinked from the Research and Development (R&amp;D) cost. The product is limited to only the cost of manufacturing and distribution. This would make the drug affordable to poor patients.</p>\n<p>The reward which pharmaceutical innovators receive solely depends on the annual gains achieved from their registered medicines. The more the medicines improve human lives, the more money the innovators gains.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://healthimpactfund.org/en/what/\">Pay-for-performance:</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Health Impact Fund provides a global integrated solution. It ensures that the product has a uniform low price worldwide. This is to ensure that innovative firms do not face any difficulty while making money in poorer countries.</p>\n<p>The Fund offers such innovative firms reward payments based on the positive impact on the patient's health no matter where the impact occurs. This approach of the Fund would help develop medicines having a global impact and also help in the development of medicines for neglected diseases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Necessity of the Health Impact Fund:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pharmaceutical companies must create medicines which are essential for global health. They must also provide access to all people once these new medicines are developed.</p>\n<p>The Health Impact Fund ensures that these concerns are fulfilled by rewarding the innovation of pharmaceutical companies creating an impact on people's health. The Fund will also ensure that with the low prices, access to the medicines shall be open to all.</p>\n<h2>1.1       <a href=\"https://healthimpactfund.org/pdf/hif_book.pdf\">Accessibility</a></h2>\n<p>Accessibility of medicines plays an important role worldwide. There are two issues which arise after making such medicines available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The accessibility of these medicines and</li>\n<li>The correct use of the medicine by people who need them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To answer the above question of whether the Fund is the answer to medicine accessibility, would show variation to a certain extent. One of the main reasons for barriers to access medicines is the price. If the price is high, the medicine automatically becomes inaccessible to poor patients or poorer countries due to its protection by patents.</p>\n<p>The Fund can help remove the barrier to accessibility, although it also much depends upon the price of manufacturing. If the manufacturing cost is low, then the consumers would be able to afford the medicines. Therefore, a small manufacturing price is crucial to attaining medicine accessibility.</p>\n<p>However, a manufacturer's price does not solely determine the cost of the product. Other factors like import duties, pharmacy board fees, inspection fees, storage and transportation cost and wholesale and retail costs, all add up to the manufacturer's price.</p>\n<p>Sometimes these supplementary prices are not passed onto the consumers since the state or non-profit sectors may provide subsidies to consumers. However, in these cases, the financial burden lies on the state and non-profit organization due to high prices. Even where the supplementary costs are partially passed onto the consumer, it still affects the affordability of medicines.</p>\n<p>Price does amount as a barrier to accessibility. However, it is not the only crucial concern that determines access. There are many low-income countries which due to their weak medical set-up limit their access to essential medicines. An inadequate infrastructure could lead to a significant amount of burden of cost and time on poor patients who need medical help.</p>\n<p>Apart from the barrier of accessibility, the second issue is the improper use of the medicine to which patients have access. Many patients end up using incorrect medicines for their treatment which would lead to an increase in the mortality rate. Even with weak infrastructure, poor patients would obtain access to medicines but with bribes or informal payments. This could impact their health and could also lead to improper use of the medicines.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Fund can be the answer to medical accessibility as it not only gives an advantage to the pharmaceutical innovators but also to the patients who need medicines. Some ways in which the Fund can be beneficial towards pharmaceutical innovations are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New incentives to pharmaceutical innovators for development of drug projects</li>\n<li>Improving their public image and contributing to world health</li>\n<li>Opportunities to help poor patients without having any financial trouble.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tropical Neglected Disease</strong></p>\n<p>The accessibility of expensive medicines can help with the diseases which have been neglected in the poor countries. Where no good treatment options are available for diseases like Malaria, Ebola, Tuberculosis, etc. the Fund can help people get access to such expensive <a href=\"https://healthimpactfund.org/en/problem/\">medicines</a>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the essence of the Fund is providing rewards to companies which register their product with the Fund. The Fund rewards payments to them based on their products impact on a patient's health regardless of whether they are rich or poor. This encourages companies to engage in research, development and <a href=\"https://healthimpactfund.org/en/how/\">marketing</a>.</p>\n<p>This would, in turn, help the Fund to preserve and improve health, by providing access to the patients who are in need of expensive medicines. It would also provide incentives to those firms to continue their manufacturing process to help the ones at risk. This acts as a win-win situation, for the patients as well as the companies.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>1.1.1                  <a href=\"https://healthimpactfund.org/pdf/High-level-panel-draft-016-02-22-formatted.docx.pdf\">Challenges faced by the Health Impact Fund</a></h3>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Technical feasibility:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The technical challenge faced by the Fund is the development of a system which measures the health impact across all countries. This system must be reliable, cost-effective and consistent with respect to all countries and diseases. In order to take into account each medicines feature, a proper plan must be worked out to ensure a fair and effective assessment of health.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Financial feasibility:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many countries have a poor administrative set up. This would anticipate a bigger amount to be spent from the Fund’s budget in the assessment process. The Fund would be dependent on the annual funding from the government or taxpayers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intellectual property issues:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Fund complements the different intellectual properties and does not alter the IP system. The Fund addresses any issues by creating an alternative method of payment. To attain rewards from the Fund the innovator must give up certain rights in their intellectual property. In the end the innovator would have to offer open licenses to ensure production of the registered product.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accountability:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Fund would be accountable to the government as well as the innovators. The innovators would be competing to ensure they gain rewards. The Fund must be responsive to these innovators for a fair process. The Fund must therefore generate a reliable system which allocates these rewards fairly. The government will also would be interested in knowing the way in which their funds are being used. Therefore, the Fund must be accountable to both and be responsive, ensuring it plays a fair and independent role.</p>\n<h3>1.1.1.1 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5844053/\">Pharmaceutical companies and Health Impact Fund</a></h3>\n<p>The Fund can play a vital role in encouraging and better-preparing pharmaceutical companies to manufacture vaccines or medicines for pandemics.</p>\n<p>Rewarding pharmaceutical companies based on their products heath impact can act as a fundamental way to encourage these companies to manufacture medicines. The more positive health impact, the greater is their reward. This incentivizes the companies since their profits are based on the impact their product has on patients.</p>\n<p>The pharmaceutical companies who register their product with the Health Impact Fund are required to sell their products worldwide. These products must be sold between the average production and marginal cost as determined by the Fund. Incentives would be provided to ensure that the retail price of such medicines is within reach of a large number of people. The drugs registered with the Fund are sold at a low price mainly directed towards the price-sensitive customers.</p>\n<p>The retail costs and taxes may increase the price for the patient and may reduce the innovators' profits. The innovators registered with the Fund will have strong incentives and would be motivated to use their lobbying power to control and reduce the taxes and retail costs.</p>\n<p>Suppliers of patented medicines are provided such incentives only when they register their product with the Fund. These suppliers sell their products at high prices. They would, therefore, not be interested in restricting their taxes and retail cost.</p>\n<p>Pharmaceutical Companies are rewarded on the basis of the impact of their products on the patient's health. This gives them an incentive to work towards how their drug is used and create interest in manufacturing accurate and precise drugs to people. The company will want to manufacture drugs which will have a long and positive impact on the patient. They will also want that drug to be accessed by all people in need of such drugs, in the right amount and right quality. They would want to manufacture such drugs which people would need and find useful.</p>\n<p>To establish that the drugs are used rationally by the needy, the following measures can be <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239795144_The_Health_Impact_Fund_Enhancing_Justice_and_Efficiency_in_Global_Health\">established</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To develop a policy of the use of essential medicines</li>\n<li>To establish a national body to incorporate several policies on drug use</li>\n<li>Preparation of guidelines and measures for the treatment of certain diseases</li>\n<li>Establishment of certain therapeutic committees</li>\n<li>Providing the proper education on the availability of medicines and their use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The factors of accessibility and rational use of the product are mostly observed in poorer countries. A proper system or method is however not available which can benefit pharma companies to ensure their products are accessible and used rationally by all.</p>\n<p>However, the Health Impact Fund does provide rewards to registered pharma companies. This acts as a strong incentive for those companies to move forward and manufacture medicines with a prolonged positive outcome. These registrants, when selling their products, will use their financial and influential powers to restrict the tax and retail prices to a minimum. This can help pharma companies to have a pressing interest in how their drugs are manufactured.</p>\n<p>These registered companies will be encouraged to make sure their products give out maximum benefits. They can engage in activities which would increase the use of their product and decrease the incorrect use of products. Therefore, these companies are expected to bring their resources to the table and carry out the manufacturing process to curb the health systems in developing countries.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Health Impact Fund can act as a contributory factor to help encourage and make better the manufacturing of medicines for any illnesses, diseases or pandemics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>About the author: </strong>Sameera Singal is currently an undergraduate student pursuing law at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n\t<p>Copyright is an exclusive bundle of rights given to the author of a literary work. This allows the author to publish his work, transform it from one medium to another, and license his rights to others. If any other person uses the copyrighted material to his advantage without the express consent of the author, he would be liable for infringement. However, in certain situations, acts that would technically amount to infringement are permitted in the light of external considerations. This article explores concepts that provide this defence.</p>\n<p>Copyright is given to authors in recognition of their creative thinking. Originality is hence central to the ownership of copyright. However, the concept is not as lucid as it may seem and has been interpreted in several ways.</p>\n<p><strong>What is originality?</strong></p>\n<p>Copyright protects the expression of an idea and not the idea itself. Hence, in the context of copyright, originality is also not necessarily that of inventive thoughts or ideas, but of their expression. However, considering that copyright is meant to reward creative minds, there exists a divide as to the amount of creativity that is needed to go into a work in order to make it worthy of copyright.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><em>Doctrine of sweat of brow</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>One view is that originality is to be evaluated in the independent skill of expression, creative labour, and judgment of the author, regardless of the novelty of the final creation. This is the main idea behind the doctrine of sweat of the brow, which credits a work to an author as long as he has toiled over it in some way.</p>\n<p>For example, in <em>University of London Press Ltd v. University Tutorial Press Ltd</em>,<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> it was held only that the work should not be copied and must have originated from the author. It need not necessarily be novel in nature. Originality need not be seen in original or inventive thought or ideas, but in expression of such in print or writing.</p>\n<p>The court in this case elaborated that the word “original” did not mean that the work must be the expression of original or inventive thought. It commented that Copyright Acts are concerned with the expression of thought in print or writing in the case of literary work, and not with the originality of ideas therein. The requirement of originality relates to the expression of the thought. However, the Acts do not require that the appearance must be in an original or novel form, but that the work must not be copied from another work; meaning only that it should originate from the author.</p>\n<p>In <em>U &amp; R Tax Services Ltd. v. H &amp; R Block Canada Inc</em>.,<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a> it was held that a work must be “original” in order to be afforded copyright, and that industriousness or “sweat of the brow” as opposed to creativity was sufficient to render such originality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Modicum of creativity</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The other perspective is that mere labour that results in no innovation does not meet the standard of originality. Even if the standard of creativity is not too high, some basic level of imagination must be used. This means that mechanical arrangements of pre-existing material, even if not per se copied, would not qualify as being original.</p>\n<p>Without this minimum level of creativity to enthuse a literary work, it would be a mere reproduction of another and would have no uniqueness or special qualities. Its existence could well be argued to be in infringement of the others like it that came before it. As a corollary, the author of such work would be barred from claiming that the reproductions that came after his work were infringing it.</p>\n<p>In <em>Key Publications Inc v. Chinatown Today Publishing Enterprises</em>,<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]</a> it was held that in case of collection and assembly of pre-existing data, the work that resulted from selection, coordination or arrangement of data was original.<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a> The United States Court of Appeal in this case added that some amount of creativity was required. Addition of certain material, arranging and presenting it in one’s own style, and making it more user friendly would require the modicum of creativity that would entail originality.</p>\n<p><strong>The Phonebook Conundrum</strong></p>\n<p>The most often cited example of the clash between the two ideologies above is that of the now-outdated phonebook. A phonebook or telephone directory is a collection of contact details of various persons, businesses and other entities within a certain area. The question is whether the author of an ordinary phonebook is worthy of receiving copyrights for his “originality”.</p>\n<p>Proponents of the sweat of brow doctrine would say yes. The labour, time and capital invested in collection of data for the phonebook is, to them, sufficient to earn copyright protection. The phone directory would be original in the sense that it was not copied from another person’s work.<a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]</a></p>\n<p>However, creativity supporters would counter that copyright law protects creations, not mere productions, and ordinary phonebooks are produced, not created. They argue that making an alphabetically arranged directory is a mechanical task requiring no creativity, and hence is underserving of copyright protection.<a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]</a></p>\n<p><strong>Modicum of Creativity: The Modern Solution?</strong></p>\n<p>The problem with compilations of fact is that the contents of each will materially be the same. Take the case of newspaper reports covering a cricket match. Information as to the happenings in the match will be the same regardless of which newspaper it is published in. Since these are facts based on events that actually took place, there is negligible scope for creativity in the contents. Nonetheless, the structure, arrangement, orientation, layout and other aspects of the presentation of such information can differ vastly, and it is here that copyright protection may be afforded.</p>\n<p>In the landmark case of <em>Feist Publications Inc. v Rural Telephone Service Co. Inc</em>.,<a href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]</a> it was held that no one can claim originality to facts: the first person to find and report a fact has merely discovered its existence. The court held that facts like names, addresses etc are not copyrightable, but compilations of facts are copyrightable.</p>\n<p>However, the court stated that factual compilations may possess the requisite originality. The author needs to choose which facts to include, what order to place them in, how to arrange the collected data for the most effective reading, and so on. These choices, so long as made independently by the person compiling the information, would involve a minimum degree of creativity. Hence, if for example the author of the compilation chooses to state the facts using an original selection of words, he or she may claim copyright in such expression of the facts.</p>\n<p>This case hence effectively debunked the doctrine of sweat of brow and brought in the mandate of a bare minimum of creativity exercised by the author, without which the bar for originality would not be crossed.</p>\n<p><strong>Indian Judgements</strong></p>\n<p>Section 13(1) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 states that copyright subsists in “original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works.” However, the Act does not provide any definition or test to determine originality of a work, presumably due to its variable nature.  This leaves the court with the duty to determine the amount of originality required for a work to claim copyright protection on a case-to-case basis.<a href=\"#_ftn8\">[8]</a></p>\n<p><em>Original Stance</em></p>\n<p>Indian courts also initially valued labour, skill and capital irrespective of creativity. The requirement laid down in <em>Macmillan v. Cooper</em>,<a href=\"#_ftn9\">[9]</a> was that the final product should have some quality or character which the raw material did not possess. In <em>Burlington Home Shopping v. Rajnish Chibber</em>,<a href=\"#_ftn10\">[10]</a> it was held that a compilation may be considered a copyrightable work since there was devotion of time, labour and skill in creating it. In <em>Mishra Bandhu v. Shivratan,<a href=\"#_ftn11\"><strong>[11]</strong></a> </em> court held that neither original thought nor original research were necessary for claiming copyright, and even compilations such as dictionaries, gazettes, maps, arithmetic, almanacs, encyclopaedias etc. were capable of having copyright.</p>\n<p>These judgements were delivered in the era where sweat of brow was widely accepted as the a qualification for originality. Over time, Indian courts too shifted preference to the modicum of creativity rule.</p>\n<p><em>Shift in Perspective</em></p>\n<p>In the landmark case of <em>Eastern Book Company v. D.B. Modak</em>,<a href=\"#_ftn12\">[12]</a> the court criticised and rejected the doctrine of sweat of brow. The court pointed out that it contained numerous flaws as it effectively extended copyright protection to the facts themselves, undesirably beyond the compiler’s selection, arrangement and original contribution. Any person subsequently compiling the same factual material would have to work on it all over again without repeating parts of the earlier published work. This violated the principle that facts and ideas cannot be copyrighted.</p>\n<p>With regard to events such as natural phenomena, the courts have agreed that no copyright would exist in facts or events which actually take place, as held in <em>Indian Express Newspaper (Bombay) Pvt Ltd v. Jagmohan</em>.<a href=\"#_ftn13\">[13]</a> This allows other to use the same facts, apply a modicum of creativity to their presentation and arrangement, and claim copyright over the final product.</p>\n<p>Compilers of factual material were hence given the liberty to use essentially the same contents as another’s work under the above doctrines. Similarly, one’s copyrighted work can also be used by someone else without infringement using the following defences.</p>\n<p><strong>Fair Use and Fair Dealing</strong></p>\n<p>The term fair use originated in the United States. A similar principle, fair dealing, exists in some other common law jurisdictions. Civil law jurisdictions have other limitations and exceptions to copyright.</p>\n<p>Fair use is a doctrine that allows restricted use of copyrighted material without acquiring permission from the right holder. It acts as a limitation and exception to the exclusive right granted by copyright law to the author of a creative work. Examples of fair use include commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching, library archiving and scholarship. It allows legal, non-licensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author's work under a four-factor balancing test: <a href=\"#_ftn14\">[14]</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit educational purposes;</li>\n<li>the nature of the copyrighted work;</li>\n<li>the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and</li>\n<li>the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fair dealing is an enumerated set of possible defences against an action for infringement of copyright. Unlike the related United States doctrine of fair use, fair dealing cannot apply to any act which does not fall within one of these categories. The concept of fair dealing is not as flexible as the American concept of fair use.</p>\n<p>The Berne three-step test was first applied to the exclusive right of reproduction via Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works in 1967. Since then, it has been transplanted and extended into the TRIPS Agreement, the WIPO Copyright Treaty, the EU Copyright Directive and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.</p>\n<p>The test is included in Article 13 of TRIPS. It reads that:</p>\n<p><em>“Members shall confine limitations and exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rights holder.”</em> <a href=\"#_ftn15\">[15]</a></p>\n<p>Thus, the test states that exclusions can be made only if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is a special case.</li>\n<li>It does not interfere with normal use of the work.</li>\n<li>It does not unreasonably hurt the legitimate interests of the copyright owner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Indian law, Section 52 of the Copyright Act, 1957, expressly permits certain uses of copyright which would otherwise amount to infringement. The provision is based on the fair use doctrine and allows some unauthorised copying of a copyrighted work without considering the copier as an infringer. It permits activities such as private use of a work for research, criticism or review, the reporting of events in a newspaper, use for judicial purposes and use by the legislature.</p>\n<p>As the term “fair use” has not been defined anywhere, the test is to understand whether its use is likely to harm the potential market or the value of copyrighted work. This doctrine has come into the limelight in the landmark cases of <em>Chancellor, Masters &amp; Scholars of University of Oxford v. Rameshwari Photocopy Services</em>,<a href=\"#_ftn16\">[16]</a> and <em>Independent News Services Pvt. Ltd v. Yashraj Films Private Limited &amp; Super Cassettes Industries Ltd</em>.<a href=\"#_ftn17\">[17]</a></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>While copyright over a literary work grants its owner the right to exploit it to the exclusion of all others, the law and courts recognise instances that amount to exceptions to this rule. The doctrine of the sweat of the brow, and concepts of a modicum of creativity, fair use and fair dealing facilitate such use considering circumstances surrounding the alleged infringement.</p>\n<p>This allows copyright infringement to be treated on a case-to-case basis, ensuring that the matter is dealt with sensitivity and the problem is given a customised solution. The courts also recognise that sometimes the copyright holder must yield for the benefit to the public at large. They hence perform the delicate Act of balancing copyright with the public interest.</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>Judgements:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>University of London Press Ltd v.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>The notion of “time is money” was born in the factories of the Industrial Revolution. Since then, people have always strived towards greater efficiency, trying to achieve more in less time. As Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”) become more conventional, stakeholders to the global intellectual property (“IP”) system are gradually adopting these tools. WIPO Director General, Francis Gurry, remarked that, “AI is a new digital frontier that will have a profound impact on the world, transforming the way we live and work.”<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a></p>\n<p>This article explores the effects of incorporation of AI and ML into the IP ecosystem, with special focus on reduction of costs in the patent process.</p>\n<p><strong>What are AI and ML?</strong></p>\n<p>While the term “AI” has been around since 1956, the technology picked up pace only around 1993-2011, when AI started to become data driven and computers became more powerful. Post 2012, more data, increased connectedness and growing computer capabilities led to breakthroughs.<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a> In 2020, increasing numbers of people use AI every day in the form of music recommender apps, Google maps, and many other services that run on AI.</p>\n<p>Machine learning is the dominant AI technique. It is found in 40% of all AI-related patents studied, and it grew at an average rate of 28% every year from 2013-2016.<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]</a> Deep learning and neural networks are techniques within machine learning that are currently revolutionizing AI.<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a> These are central to processes like automatic translation.</p>\n<p><strong>AI and ML in the IP System</strong></p>\n<p>AI and ML are making a slow but steady entry into various aspects of the IP system, such as through the increasingly popular concept of smart contracts. A smart contract is a computer coded contract which makes use of blockchain technology and is self-executing.<a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]</a> It can be used for the assignment of IP, which would occur automatically upon receipt of the consideration amount. By removing the need for human intervention post execution of the contract, administrative costs are reduced, and hence efficiency is improved. <a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]</a></p>\n<p>The overarching goal is to reduce the amount of manual labour involved at various stages of the IP life cycle. IBM is now offering an IP advisor named Watson that uses AI for fast patent processing, better insights, and analytics. IBM’s Watson is capable of analysing massive amounts of unstructured data input in several languages and from varied sources.<a href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]</a></p>\n<p>AI and ML are also finding use in detection and consequent prevention of infringements. For instance, Red Points, a brand protection company based in New York and Barcelona, developed a client-centric platform that can identify unauthorised sellers of a company’s products and track pirated content such as video and films.<a href=\"#_ftn8\">[8]</a></p>\n<p><strong>How Can AI and ML Reduce Costs in the Patent Process?</strong></p>\n<p>Patent software companies are now relying on AI to produce advanced patent tools. They are adopting a hybrid approach to give conventional patent tools an AI upgrade. <a href=\"#_ftn9\">[9]</a> AI and ML have the following applications in the patent process.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><em>Prior art search</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>AI-based tools can review vast amounts of data in short amounts of time and hence are apt for prior art search, which requires the examination of millions of documents in various databases. A survey conducted on 60 senior in-house patent lawyers across industries found that prior art search was the most popular choice of the best use for AI in the patenting process.<a href=\"#_ftn10\">[10]</a> Previously, prior art search could take between two and four days, but AI can do the job in just a few hours, giving the searcher a head start when it comes to manual analysis.<a href=\"#_ftn11\">[11]</a></p>\n<p>More advanced solutions include natural language search tools that allow users to input natural language terms. The AI tool understands these terms and uses them to retrieve the requested documents and give suitable search results. Apart from prior art searches, such tools can be used to identify potential patent infringements.<a href=\"#_ftn12\">[12]</a></p>\n<p>AI is already in use in some countries due to its time-saving benefits. The European Patent Office’s master database contains 108 million documents. It processes about 30 million search reports from patent authorities and 79 million full-text records in various languages. Staff at the EPO say its technology can scan all of these with ease.<a href=\"#_ftn13\">[13]</a> In 2018, Austria’s patent office conducted trials with several commercial providers of AI to help with the classification of patent filings. The Norwegian Industrial Property Office has begun using an AI-based tool to conduct trademark image searches.<a href=\"#_ftn14\">[14]</a></p>\n<p>AI and ML also analyse the behaviour of the searcher, compare and include competitor and market information with patent data and thus, incorporate market and business information in the analysis. <a href=\"#_ftn15\">[15]</a></p>\n<p>Prior art search, which would take teams of searchers a few days to complete, can now be done in just a few hours with a fraction of the manual labour, thus saving tremendously on costs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Language translation</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One major hurdle typically encountered by patent applicants during the patent filing process is the language barrier. It not only restricts them while filing for a patent in different jurisdictions as the procedural instructions are unintelligible, but also comes in the way of understanding what has already been patented in that jurisdiction. Applicants then turn to professional translation service providers, which increases costs involved in obtaining the patent.</p>\n<p>Semantic-based algorithms focus on performing document retrieval by identifying the meaning of the words used in accordance with an appropriate context. They can hence help a searcher to find the most relevant documents irrespective of the terminology or language used.<a href=\"#_ftn16\">[16]</a></p>\n<p>The use of AI to translate documents filed in different languages can hence make a country’s patent filing processes as well as document database more widely accessible and understandable. Translation costs are a significant component of the process of filing a patent in different jurisdictions, and could be dramatically reduced with the usage of ML. This could pave the way for larger numbers of patent applications, thus contributing to economic development.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Assessment of patentability</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patent lawyers can use the new wave of technology to improve their own efficiency. AI can process large volumes of data and identify patterns that would be impossible or too time-consuming for humans to detect. For example, it can analyse descriptions of similar products and compare them using image recognition.</p>\n<p>AI can detect immediately whether or not applications meet criteria such as novelty, inventive step and industrial application to make them eligible for patents. AI can also pre-classify incoming applications to assign the file to the correct unit and automate the annotation of patent literature.<a href=\"#_ftn17\">[17]</a> This makes the process of assessing whether an invention is patentable faster and easier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Benefits for inventors and patent applicants</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patent attorneys and intellectual property offices across the world are not the only organisations turning to AI. Companies and innovators can use it to keep track of their own inventions and intellectual property.</p>\n<p>This technology can create value for client companies by unearthing patents that were forgotten because they have moved out of a particular product line. The companies can then generate revenue by selling these patents.<a href=\"#_ftn18\">[18]</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Detection and prevention of infringements</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>AI is also becoming an essential tool for patent attorneys working to protect their clients’ intellectual property. For example, US-based legal analytics start-up DataNovo uses big data to conduct prior art searches and to identify patent infringements. Such technology helps companies engaged in designing new products to avoid infringing someone else’s IP. After conducting a rapid assessment of similar existing products, they can either tweak their own design accordingly or obtain a licence to avoid causing a breach of IP rights.<a href=\"#_ftn19\">[19]</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Prediction of outcome of litigation</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>AI can even support patent actions in court by predicting the result of a case. For instance, on the basis of detailed historical data of cases, AI can determine situations in which a particular judge has decided favourably. Companies and patent attorneys can use this information to build their litigation strategy and decide whether to settle a certain case, or to fight it out in court. This aspect is controversial as it detracts from the human discretion which plays a vital role in judicial decisions and could result in judges losing value.</p>\n<p>Based on prior cases, it is even possible to analyse the way an adversary conducts litigation and gives an idea as to whether they tend to settle at a certain point or fight to the bitter end. However, this would require feeding AI the data of millions of court cases, all of which must be formatted in the exact way to make them accessible to the relevant AI tools.<a href=\"#_ftn20\">[20]</a></p>\n<p>Better prior art searches curated by AI can also help firms plan litigation strategy better by knowing which patents can be challenged.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges and the Way Ahead</strong></p>\n<p>Several concerns arise with respect to the inclusion of AI and ML into the IP system. What ownership and regulatory models should apply to data, which is essential to the development of AI? Is an invention generated by AI eligible for IP protection and, if so, who owns those rights? Free access to data can provide highly personalized experiences, but how can this be balanced with personal privacy concerns? <a href=\"#_ftn21\">[21]</a> Questions like these must be addressed at a global level.</p>\n<p>All jurisdictions currently require a human individual to be registered as the inventor in a patent application. The doubt arises when a discovery or invention is created entirely or in part by AI: who is the “inventor”? This could lead to disputes over whom the credit should go to in case of an AI-aided discovery. Issues of inventorship, obviousness and plausibility would then arise while patenting AI-discovered inventions. <a href=\"#_ftn22\">[22]</a> Once AI and ML begin to play a larger role in identifying solutions and inventions, laws surrounding the disclosure of the role of AI in an invention may need to change.</p>\n<p>Patent Offices today evaluate whether patent applications pass the test of “inventive step” based on the limitations of human imagination. In the case of machine-invented products and processes, patent offices may choose to raise this bar for inventive step, thus making it more difficult to obtain a patent. They may even find it difficult to understand and accept how a machine could come up with a particular idea. <a href=\"#_ftn23\">[23]</a> The economic and societal impact of non-human inventions would receive sharp focus in this case.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>One can agree with Andrew NG, CEO of Landing AI and deeplearning.ai, who said that, “AI is the new electricity. I can hardly imagine an industry which is not going to be transformed by AI.” AI and ML are making services and processes easier across the globe by reducing human error and human effort. It is time for the stakeholders of the IP system to embrace this technology at a measured pace.</p>\n<p>It is evident that the use of AI and ML can dramatically reduce costs incurred at various points of the patent process, making it cheaper and easier to apply for patents and to process applications. However, while the benefits are alluring, one must be wary of the unaddressed concerns that accompany the incorporation of this technology. Yes, AI and ML can reduce costs. But at what cost?</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><em>The Story of AI in Patents</em>, World Intellectual Property Organisation (Accessed 27 May 2020) https://www.wipo.int/tech_trends/en/artificial_intelligence/story.html.</li>\n<li>Sarah Neil, Mike Jennings and Nikesh Patel, <em>The benefits of Artificial Intelligence in the field of IP</em>, Lexology (Accessed 27 May 2020) https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=43b8660b-8e61-42ff-9d2c-d5ed5d9f730c.</li>\n<li>Amit Goel,&nbsp;Prashant Singhal and&nbsp;Raj Kishore, <em>Why AI is crucial for patent searching and mining</em>, Lexology (Accessed 27 May 2020) https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ece7e6a5-7a3c-499d-9c00-4cb37f031e78.</li>\n<li>Sarah Murray, <em>AI drives down cost and drudgery of routine patent work</em>, Financial Times (Accessed 27 May 2020) https://www.ft.com/content/80ae35aa-7711-11e9-b0ec-7dff87b9a4a2.</li>\n<li>Patent Strategy, Machine yearning: AI and patents, ManagingIP (Accessed 27 May 2020) <a href=\"https://www.managingip.com/pdfsmip/Machine-yearning-AI-and-patents.pdf\">https://www.managingip.com/pdfsmip/Machine-yearning-AI-and-patents.pdf</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong> :</p>\n<p>Tanvi Chaturvedi is a fifth-year student of the B.A.LL.B (Hons.) course at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you are starting your business or launching a tech startup, you need to take a lot of steps to make sure that you successfully get your business off the ground and set it on a path that will bring you profit and help you meet the needs of your future customers.</p>\n<p>One of the most essential steps to take when launching a website or a mobile app is creating privacy policy and terms and conditions agreements.</p>\n<p>These legal agreements are extremely valuable for both you and your customers or clients, because not only do they inform people about everything that they are agreeing to when they start using your services, but they also protect your company against certain legal claims.</p>\n<p>Though, many business owners with websites and mobile app services generally don't realize the difference between terms and conditions and privacy policy agreements and neither they know how to draft them, therefore they end up making their business vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Both Privacy Policy and Terms and Condition agreements have different purposes, you need to make sure that you fully understand what each of them is and why you really need them, so read on.</p>\n<p><strong>What is a Privacy Policy?</strong></p>\n<p>A privacy policy agreement is a legal document that informs your users about the collection, storage, sharing and use of their personal information. This is required by law, so you should never skip this step before you actually launch your website or mobile app.</p>\n<p>For example, all websites collect data about their visitors in one way or another. This is even more applicable in the case of an e-commerce store. E-commerce sites typically collect personal data like names, email address, IP addresses, session activity and payment details, to name a few. For this reason, a privacy policy is vital as it protects website and mobile app owners and customers alike, while also ensuring that your website or mobile app complies with all the legal obligations.</p>\n<p>If you collect, store and use any kind of personal information from your website or mobile app users, you must create a proper privacy policy agreement in order to let them know that you will collect and use that information.</p>\n<p>It should be provided to them through your website or the app before they actually start using them.</p>\n<p><em>What exactly is meant by \"personal information\"?</em></p>\n<p>Personal information includes your users' names, addresses, email addresses, IP addresses, date of birth and credit card information and anything by which your users can be identified.</p>\n<p>A privacy policy should not only merely inform your users of the fact that their personal information will be collected and used when they start using your services, but it also needs to let them know exactly what information will be collected and how, as well as how and for what purposes it will be used.</p>\n<p>For instance, you may collect their email addresses, so that you can send updates about your products or services.</p>\n<p>Your privacy policy also needs to let your users know whether or not all the collected information will be shared with some third parties, as well as whether or not using your website or mobile app will result in some data being stored on your users' computers or mobile devices.</p>\n<p>It is very important to note that you should still have a privacy policy agreement in place even if you collect only non-personal information from your users.</p>\n<p>That kind of information includes their zip codes, the pages that they visit on your website, the web browsers, and devices they are using to visit your site and anything that cannot be used to identify your users.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is a privacy policy so important? Why do you need it?</strong></p>\n<p>At this point, it’s clear that a privacy policy is very much important for any business with a website or a mobile app.</p>\n<p>This means that if you have a website and you intend to have people visit that website, then it’s important that you include a privacy policy.</p>\n<p>The law requires you to inform users about what data you collect, how it’s used, stored and protected. As a matter of fact, under the new EU GDPR legislation and US’s CCPA legislations, it’s also necessary that your privacy policy inform users of their rights in regards to their data. The disclosures should be transparent, easily understandable, comprehensive and up-to-date. Failure to meet regulatory requirements can result in hefty fines in certain countries where it is mandatory to create privacy policy for your websites and mobiles apps. These regulations apply to all organizations (including non-profits) that access data or offer goods or services to people in the EU. The GDPR applies whether your organization is located in the EU or not.</p>\n<p>Not only is a privacy policy crucial to ensuring that legal requirements are met and customer trust is maintained, but many third-party apps and services require it. One example, is Google? In order to access certain services and tools (for example, AdSense, Google Analytics, etc.), Google requires that you have a comprehensive and up-to-date privacy policy in place on your website.</p>\n<p>Apart from being required by law (although not in all countries, still highly recommended), a privacy policy comes down to the question of privacy, obviously.</p>\n<p>You need to show your website or mobile app users that they can trust you and that you will handle all of the collected and stored information of them with the utmost care and protection.</p>\n<p>Hence, the main purpose of this legal document is protecting you and your company against any kind of legal liability and claims. Even if you don't collect any kind of information, your users need to know that, because you certainly want them to feel safe and secure when using any of your services.</p>\n<p>If you don't collect any information at first, but choose to start doing it after a while, make sure that you update your privacy policy and let your users know in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>Therefore, this means that you need to inform your users about the updated privacy policy in advance so that they can decide whether or not they want to continue using your services.</p>\n<p><strong>Protects Your Company Against Legal Implications</strong></p>\n<p>If one of your website’s visitors suffers identity theft as a result of a data leak and sues your company, your privacy policy may be able to serve as a defence to show that you took reasonable care of your visitors’ personal data, as you cannot be expected to prevent every possible unforeseeable data leak.</p>\n<p><strong>What Should a Privacy Policy Include?</strong></p>\n<p>What needs to go into your privacy policy depends on a huge variety of factors. There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all privacy policy that can be simply copied and pasted.</p>\n<p>The most important of these factors is where the visitors to your website are likely to be located. This will determine under what country’s laws you owe privacy obligations to them.</p>\n<h2>What is a terms and conditions agreement?</h2>\n<p>A terms and conditions agreement (also known as a \"Terms of Use\" or \"Terms of Service\" agreement) is a legal document that sets out the rules, guidelines, and requirements that your users must agree to abide by in order to be able to use your services.</p>\n<p>The terms and conditions set forth the conditions, clauses, terms, and requirements related to using the app or website. This legal agreement sets the requirements, rules, and standards of using the website or app. As an example, a section that's common on the terms and conditions section includes account deactivation if a user misuses the app or website, copyright information, billing and subscription information, and other various disclaimers. This agreement isn't required to have by law, but it's highly recommended in order to prevent abuse from happening to the website or mobile app. It also limits the owner's legal liability of the online business.Therefore, in order for people to use your website or mobile app, you need to clearly state what they need to do if they want to use them, as well as what you will do in case of some violations of the rules that you lay out in the agreement. Your terms and conditions agreement should include your copyright details, your billing, and subscription policies (especially important for SaaS companies), potential warranties on your services, potential modifications of your services, and how exactly your users may use your website or mobile app.This agreement should also include what will happen if a user doesn't abide by your rules and guidelines and if they abuse your website or mobile app. For instance, they may be requested to pay a fine, or they may be temporarily or permanently banned from using your services.</p>\n<p>You should also make sure that your terms and conditions agreement includes a disclaimer notice that will limit your company's liability. This means stating that you will not be held responsible if someone finds some kind of information on your website or mobile app to be incorrect.</p>\n<p>Although this agreement is not required by law, it is highly recommended that you have it, precisely because of limiting your liability, as well as for protecting your company against any potential abuses of your website or mobile app, such as copyright infringement, for instance.</p>\n<p>It is very important to protect your intellectual property, such as your logo, your unique web or mobile app design and your content (unless the content is user-generated), which is yet another reason for having a terms and conditions agreement.</p>\n<p>Therefore, you should make sure that you include the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://legalvision.com.au/drafting-sales-terms-and-conditions-write-clause-intellectual-property/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Intellectual Property clause</a>&nbsp;in your terms and conditions. Also, you should include the Governing Law clause to show that the law of the country that you operate in governs your terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>Apart from limiting legal liability and protecting your business against any kind of abuse, this legal document also enables you to build credibility and trust with your users.</p>\n<p>You inform them of their rights and responsibilities towards your company and business, as well as yours towards them, which shows that you are a professional who is trustworthy.</p>\n<p>Just like with your privacy policy, you need to let your users know about the potential modifications of your terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>If you plan on changing anything in your agreement, you need to inform them about the changes in advance and clearly state when they are going to take place.</p>\n<h2>Whether Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions are created as a Single agreement or separate agreements?</h2>\n<p>Some website and mobile app owners combine their privacy policy and terms and conditions into a single agreement. What they usually do is incorporate their privacy policy into their terms and conditions agreement by creating a separate section for it.</p>\n<p>This is not recommended because it is simply much easier for their users to take a look at both documents and, thus, fully understand what each of them entails. This is certainly a much smarter option, so you should always keep your terms and conditions and your privacy policy separate.</p>\n<p>It is highly recommended to keep your legal agreements separate as, it also lets your users know that each of the documents has a completely different purpose. It also helps them understand and comprehend and retain all of the information easier.</p>\n<p>But you need to make sure that the agreements are easy, clear, concise and written in plain language that your users will be able to understand because not everyone will understand various legal and technical terms.</p>\n<p>At this point, you certainly realize how crucial it is to have both&nbsp;terms and conditions&nbsp;and&nbsp;privacy policy&nbsp;agreements in place, as well as how essential it is to keep the two separated.</p>\n<p>These agreements will help your website or mobile app users feel safe and secure when using your services, so you can easily form meaningful relationships with them and expand your customer base.</p>\n<p>Moreover, you will effectively protect your business against any potential legal claims and liabilities by your website visitors or mobile app users and make sure that it stays on the right road to success.</p>\n<p>Therefore, make sure that you properly and carefully draft these legal documents and that you make them clearly available and easily accessible by your users.</p>\n<p><strong>If Your Website’s Visitors are Located in Singapore</strong></p>\n<p>If most of your visitors will be in Singapore, then the law governing their privacy is the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).</p>\n<p>The PDPA requires that you obtain your visitors’ consent to collect whatever data you are collecting from them, for whatever purposes you need to use it.</p>\n<p>For example, if your company’s website uses cookies to collect data from your visitors, consent can be obtained by including a pop-up or banner which requires visitors to accept cookies being stored in order to continue using the website.</p>\n<p><strong>If Your Website’s Visitors are Located within the European Union or European Economic Area</strong></p>\n<p>If some of your visitors are located within the European Union or the European Economic Area (even if your company is not located within either area), then the applicable law is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>\n<p>This law was introduced in May 2018 and grants European residents a wide range of privacy rights. For more information, see our guide on how Singapore companies can comply with the GDPR.</p>\n<p><strong>If Your Website’s Visitors are Located in USA</strong></p>\n<p>California is the first state to adopt state-wide privacy legislation in the US through the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which came into effect on January 1, 2020.</p>\n<p>The Golden State follows in the footsteps of the major changes done by GDPR to the use of personal information on the Internet. Other states that acted similarly are Maine and Nevada, but which only passed new privacy legislation or amendments to existing law.</p>\n<p>The CCPA differs from the GDPR by giving its users full power and responsibility to request businesses to disclose or delete the data they have already collected, or to opt-out completely of third-party data sales.</p>\n<p>The CCPA applies to every company in the world if it collects personal data of California residents.</p>\n<p>According to the local laws of California, any person who is in California for other than a temporary or transitory purpose or has their domicile within the state borders is a California resident. This definition is available whether they are accessing the internet from inside or outside California.</p>\n<p>GDPR and CCPA are at the forefront of the privacy legislation, and both laws have prodded jurisdictions to enact similar data privacy laws. For businesses, their Website policy must be compliant with these regulations. It should collect/process data in harmony with the provisions of these laws.</p>\n<p><strong>Engaging a Legal Consultant or a Lawyer to Draft a Privacy Policy</strong></p>\n<p>Because of the bespoke nature of privacy policies, it is advisable to engage a lawyer or a legal consultant to draft one for your website rather than trying to draft one yourself.</p>\n<p>The pricing by law firms of this service is usually extremely competitive and affordable.</p>\n<p>They will sit down with you to figure out how the factors above apply to your company, what your company’s data collection and retention needs actually are and come up with a policy that’s actually usable for your company.</p>\n<p><em>Our team is adept at drafting&nbsp;website&nbsp;policies that adhere to the privacy laws of different jurisdictions.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p><strong>SUSPENSION OF IBC: IS IT REASONABLE? WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES FOR MSMES TO RECOVER THEIR DUES?</strong></p>\n<p>The COVID- 19 outbreak caused an unprecedented economic slowdown around the world, and India is no exception. The profits of MSMEs have plummeted, and some have even ceased operations. To ease the burden on the MSMEs, the government of India has decided to suspend certain sections of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of 2016 (IBC), for the next six months extendable to a year<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Pre IBC era</strong></p>\n<p>India implemented the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code in 2016, and it was the successor to the&nbsp;SICA&nbsp;or the Sick Industrial Companies Act, 1985.&nbsp;SICA&nbsp;was introduced to battle the widespread industrial sickness plaguing the economy in the 1980s. The act defined sick companies as those, which had been in existence for at least five years, and by the end of a financial year, accumulated losses are equal to or more than its net worth. Such companies were unable to pay their debts and, thus, insolvent.&nbsp;SICA&nbsp;laid down provisions to identify such companies and revive them. It was later replaced by the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act of 2003, which aimed at filling the lacuna left by the previous act.</p>\n<p>Prior to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, there existed a tedious legal framework which dealt with issues of insolvency and bankruptcy. This included Acts such as&nbsp;SICA, Securitisation, and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act (SARFESI Act), Companies Act, etc<a href=\"#_edn2\">[ii]</a>. These Acts dealt with insolvency procedures for different types of companies. However, these legislations often conflicted with each other and, thus, made the entire process cumbersome. A better insolvency mechanism was required to promote entrepreneurship and improve the ease of doing business. This led to the establishment of the IBC, which subsumed insolvency related provisions of all the previous Acts and created a single consolidated code.</p>\n<p>The IBC has a much wider scope as compared to its predecessors. It makes the process of insolvency and bankruptcy smoother and simpler. It also introduced quicker mechanisms for the completion of the insolvency and bankruptcy procedures. The code prioritizes the interest of the company's employees and balances the interests of all stakeholders. Furthermore, it has created three bodies to improve the functioning of the code, which are the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), the Insolvency Professionals Agency (IPA) and Information Utilities (IU). Therefore, it has created a robust structure to deal with the issues of Insolvency and Bankruptcy in India.</p>\n<p><strong><em><u>Is the suspension of IBC reasonable?</u></em></strong></p>\n<p>The outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown has slowed down the economy and is a threat to industries, especially to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises ( MSMEs). The government of India recognized their peril and thus decided to suspend Section 7, 9, and 10 of the IBC. These sections deal with the initiation of insolvency proceedings by a financial creditor, operational creditor, and the company itself, respectively. The objective of this move is to save companies from insolvency or bankruptcy and giving them respite from immediate repayment of their dues.</p>\n<p>Due to the economic slowdown caused by Covid-19, companies are likely to default on their payments. Under normal circumstances, this would lead to the initiation of insolvency proceedings against them. A resolution professional would then, take over the company and its assets and would lay down the criteria by which other companies could take over or support the sick company.</p>\n<p>Since this process requires a third party to show interest in taking over a sick company, it will not prove to be successful in the present circumstances. The pandemic has caused a financial crisis due to which companies will not have the resources to finance distressed companies. The lack of investors in a company will force it to go into liquidation. This will mean that all its assets will be sold off to pay back the creditors and other stakeholders.</p>\n<p>However, the resale value of assets has also plummeted in the present economy due to which the creditors will not be able to recover the amount due. On the contrary, if the company is allowed to continue, it will be able to exploit its potential and payback its dues. This will prove to be a more lucrative step for the future.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the government's move to suspend provisions above of IBC will provide succour, especially to MSMEs. It is also unlikely to cause long term harm to creditors. Providing short term respite to companies will allow them to redeem their losses and repay creditors<a href=\"#_edn3\">[iii]</a>. It will also increase the value of their assets which will also profit creditors in the long run. This relief will also give the companies a morale boost to work better to improve their situation.</p>\n<p><strong>The fallouts of Suspension of IBC</strong></p>\n<p>While the move of the government is welcomed by many, on the flip side, it has also faced criticism. The step aims at preventing a large number of companies from going into liquidation due to non-payment of dues. However, this is deemed to be unnecessary because the government has already increased the minimum amount of default to trigger insolvency proceedings, from the earlier Rs 1 Lakh to Rs 1 crore. By increasing the threshold limit, the government has ensured that a large number of companies don’t go into liquidation, in the absence of assistance from financers. Therefore, both the policies have the same net effect but suspending the IBC invites a barrage of other issues with it.<a href=\"#_edn4\">[iv]</a></p>\n<p>Another criticism of this policy was that it does not provide any protection from other recovery laws. For instance, a creditor mostly holds a mortgage over the immovable property of the debtor. Thus, even if a creditor cannot start insolvency proceedings, it can decide to sell the property with minimum intervention from the courts. The SARFESI Act also allows the creditor to take over the management of the debtor's company<a href=\"#_edn5\">[v]</a>. Furthermore, Under Part III of the IBC, if promoters and directors have provided a personal guarantee, they may be taken to the insolvency court. Thus, the step taken by the government may prove to be counterproductive if such provisions are not amended.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the suspension of Section 10 of the IBC may hurt the companies more than aiding them. Since now, the company has no way to exit from the market, even if it can no longer carry out its operations successfully. The freedom to exit from the market ensures that resources that are not exploited efficiently can be relocated to more successful endeavours. Therefore, the government has been condemned for its lack of foresight and half-baked planning to help distressed companies.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Alternatives ways for MSMEs to recover their dues</u></strong></p>\n<p>Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises ( MSMEs) are different from other enterprises. They are entrepreneurial ventures with the local market as their focus. They have emerged rapidly in recent years and are essential to the Indian economy. However, MSMEs are more susceptible to irregularities in the market. The outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic has especially affected these small and medium-sized enterprises. Unlike big enterprises, MSMEs do not possess the capital and resources to deal with a delay in recovering their dues. Therefore, this sector can go into distress and may collapse. The government has acknowledged its growing concerns regarding the same via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1607942\">press statements</a><a href=\"#_edn6\">[vi]</a>. The statements which released in March and May, have highlighted the importance of MSMEs.</p>\n<p><strong>MSMED Act</strong></p>\n<p>Since the provisions of the IBC have been suspended at present, registered MSMEs can take advantage of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act (MSMED), 2006. This act was formulated to support the development of MSMEs. This act provides an alternative by which MSMEs, including startups, can recover their dues. Under the IBC, MSMEs often had to restructure, which had a major impact on them and their working. However, MSMED Act provides a simpler way for MSMEs to recover their dues and also provides the necessary safeguard to ensure timely payment is made. The speedy process also ensures that there is no loss of operations.</p>\n<p>This MSMED act makes a buyer liable to pay the amount due on or before a pre-decided date. If there isn't any agreement between the parties, the deadline to receive payment is within 45 days from the date of acceptance of goods or services. The act provides a safeguard in case the buyer does not pay within the stipulated time. The buyer is made liable to pay compound interest on the due amount, at three times the bank lending rate for any goods or services provided. For example, if the current bank rate is 5% the MSME would be entitled to receive 15% of interest on the due amount. If such amount isn't paid then the enterprise can refer the case to the Micro and Small Enterprise Facilitation Council (MSEFC). The act mandates each dispute to be decided within 90 days from the date on which the case was referred. Thus, creating a stringent framework by which MSMEs can recover their dues.</p>\n<p>The MSMED has also updated with time to assist MSMEs. For instance, the act recently developed an online portal for the filing of the applications by the micro and small enterprises that further relieves them from the litigation costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Pre-package restructuring</strong></p>\n<p>Another way in which MSMEs can benefit is if the government decides to introduce a pre-pack restructuring or resolution mechanism for them. While the government announced its decision to suspend sections of the IBC, the insolvency resolution framework for MSMEs is yet to be announced. Therefore, the government may take steps to propose the Pre-packaged insolvency as an alternate solution. Pre-package insolvency is a mix of out of court settlements and formal insolvency proceedings. The process involves both parties, i.e. the creditor and debtor, agreeing on restructuring or investment by the third party, before commencing the insolvency process. This allows for pre-agreed terms, which have the approval of both parties, to be implemented through IBC mechanisms. It is done under the supervision of the insolvency court and is binding on all the stakeholders.<a href=\"#_edn7\">[vii]</a></p>\n<p>The IBC disallows promoters of an insolvent company from acquiring it but pre-pack incentivizes the existing management to revive a company. This ensures continuity in business and avoids delays caused by a change in management. Pre-packaged insolvency also reduces the money and time spent on the litigation process. In the case of the US Company, Sungard Availability Services, a pre-packaged insolvency was confirmed within 19 hours, making it the fastest bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p>However, in India, Pre-packs may face certain challenges because it puts the debtor in charge of the management of the company. This conflicts with the prevailing model of having the creditors in charge under the IBC. Thus, the structural framework of the insolvency laws will need amendment. Nevertheless, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, pre-package insolvency will strike a balance between the concerns of both debtors and creditors. Therefore, providing the MSMEs with an alternate approach to recover their dues helps them tackle the economic havoc wreaked by the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>In Conclusion, the government’s plan to suspend the IBC is an affirmative measure. However, unless the policy makers introduce other changes to supplement the move, it may not prove to be successful. Furthermore, suspending the IBC delays the financial trouble that companies are facing but it does not remedy it. The government needs to introduce economic policies which incentivise companies to perform better and thus, boost the economy.</p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>\n<p>Tuhina Sahai is a 5<sup>th</sup> Year Student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the emergence of Capital Markets in the late 1970s, the government realized that several malpractices had also surfaced which aimed at exploiting the loopholes of the market. This realization led the government to introduce a body to help regulate the market and keep malpractices at bay. In 1992, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was established under the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. SEBI is the body that regulates securities and commodity markets in India. According to SEBI Act's <a href=\"https://www.sebi.gov.in/about-sebi.html\">preamble</a>, its basic function is \"to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto\".&nbsp;[i]</p>\n<p>SEBI deals with curbing activities that harm the open market and thus, has prohibited the practice of Insider trading. Insider trading is malpractice where a person who has access to confidential information relating to the company, uses it to make investments and thus, profit. For instance, if an insider, such as a key employee or executive, knows strategic information about the company and use the same for trading in the company's stocks or securities.</p>\n<p>The rationale behind banning Insider trading is that such an act would breach the trust that the company and shareholders have in its employees. It is an unjust practice because the insider is privileged to information according to which they can decide to buy or sell stocks of a company. It, thus, puts all other stockholders at a disadvantaged position.</p>\n<p>Therefore, SEBI must keep a check at this practice. SEBI (Insider Trading) Regulation, 1992 framed under Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992, prohibits and prevents insider trading in Securities. Over the years, the government has tried to evolved the laws related to insider trading and introduce various guidelines and amendments to the laws. However, even with a legal framework in place, India has often been criticized for not being able to curb the practice of insider trading efficiently.</p>\n<p>In April 2020, the market regulator, Securities, and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) convicted two people of, among other things, violating insider trading norms. In its investigations, SEBI found that Arvind Babulal Goyal and Pooja Arvind Goyal were committing insider trading in a company called <a href=\"https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/apr-2020/adjudication-order-in-respect-of-arvind-babulal-goyal-in-the-matter-of-incap-financial-services-limited-_46625.html\">Incap Financial Services</a>[ii]. This was one of the first convictions by SEBI concerning the practice of Insider Trading.</p>\n<p><strong><u>CAUSES FOR SEBI'S FAILURE AT CURBING INSIDER TRADING</u></strong><u></u></p>\n<p>Critics have censured SEBI for its inability to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of insider trading. Even with a robust structure of laws in place, there has not been much progress in convicting a person for insider trading. In the five years from 2014 to 2019, SEBI took up 141 cases of insider trading violations for investigations but completed only half of those probes. To understand why SEBI is unsuccessful in apprehending people, we need to understand the process of dealing with an insider trading case and its obstacles.</p>\n<p>Identifying insider trading proves to be tricky. Most people undertaking this practice are cautious and do not leave behind obvious clues that can be detected by SEBI. Thus, even in order to start an investigation, regulators have to trace the economic activities of people. The collection of evidence proves to be a further obstacle in this case[iii]. If there is no whistleblower or informant to give precise information, finding evidence is often challenging and time taking.</p>\n<p>Lack of conviction by SEBI can be contributed to the following factors:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Power to look into call records</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As it is, SEBI found it difficult to collect evidence, but till very recently, it did not have the basic investigative tools such as the power to call upon a person's phone records. This power was given to SEBI in 2013 when a huge Ponzi scheme called, Sharada scam was unearthed. The scam resulted in the Indian government urgently passing the Securities Laws (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2013, which <a href=\"https://indiacorplaw.in/2018/02/sebi-failing-regulating-insider-trading-india.html#_ftnref1\">permitted SEBI</a> to call for the phone records of persons under investigation[iv]. Without having the basic power to looks at people's phone records, the regulators have to analyze their trade patterns on the stock market and track their activities. Many offenders still found a way out of this by trading in the name of dummy companies. However, the new amendment allows SEBI to use this power as long as it can justify that such records were used for genuine investigation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Lack of power to wiretap phone calls</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Presently SEBI lacks the power to wiretap any phone calls. India finds this to be controversial and the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 governs wiretapping. However, these practices are often used in other countries to control insider trading. For instance, in USA, wiretapping phones is allowed to obtain evidence against insider trading suspects for the&nbsp; investigation and successful conviction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Lack of Human Resources&nbsp;</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently, SEBI simply lacks the human resource that is required by it for proper investigations. It is estimated that in India, there is one employee for every six companies listed on the Indian exchange. In comparison, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission which has one employee for each company. This shows that we have a deficiency of investigators who can devote their entire time to thorough research and analysis.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Lack of utilization of existing powers and provisions&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it is true that SEBI lacks certain necessities for conducting investigations, a review of its cases brings to the fore the under-utilization of its resources. For instance, SEBI has the power to levy a penalty of up to Rs. 25,00,00,000 or three times the amount of profits made, whichever is higher, under Section 15G of the SEBI Act. However, in practice, the highest penalty that has been levied is Rs. 60,00,000. Further, SEBI has also never utilized the power to petition before a criminal court and institute criminal proceedings against a person. By doing this, SEBI could demand the imprisonment of people who are convicted. However, even in controversial and big cases, this power has never been used.</p>\n<p><strong><u>WAYS IN WHICH SEBI CAN IMPROVE</u></strong></p>\n<p>SEBI has not been successful in dealing with insider trading. It takes a long time to conclude all of its investigations. Even if athe person is convicted the punishment and penalty are so low that the regulations have lost its effects. To understand the situation in India, we must compare its insider trading laws with that of other countries.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Comparison of insider trading laws from other jurisdictions</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>United States of America</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The United States has historically been the world leader in insider trading law. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1909 established that because a company's director could affect the value of his company's shares, he can manipulate the market by selling his shares at the sign of distress while keeping the other buyers in the dark. This would be deceitful and therefore, fraudulent[v]. The USA has a robust legal framework to deal with insider trading. It passed the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, to prevent insider trading. Further, the Securities and Exchange Commission in the USA is the most active of all the world's financial regulatory institutions at prosecuting insider trading. From 2001 to 2005, the United States brought <a href=\"http://www.macrothink.org/journal/index.php/ijafr/article/viewFile/3269/2976\">271 enforcement actions</a>.[vi]</p>\n<p>Penalties against a person found to be doing insider trading is a maximum of 20 years in prison and a fine of $5 million. In addition, those convicted of insider trading can face civil penalty fines, which can be up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of an unlawful purchase.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>United Kingdom</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the U.K., an insider is any person who has inside information. They define 'inside' information as \"information that is not generally available and that a reasonable investor would use to help them make investment decisions\". Therefore, the information must be material. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is the body that regulates securities trading in U.K. Even though insider trading had been prohibited since 1980, U.K. too was criticized for its lack of convictions and slow enforcement. In 2000, the Financial Services and Markets Act was passed, which laid down stricter and more specific guidelines.</p>\n<p>The punishment for insider trading or any kind of market abuse is a maximum of seven years imprisonment or an unlimited fine. On top of these penalties, a wider range of civil penalties could be imposed.</p>\n<p>In comparison, India has been slightly slower in its approach to insider trading. For instance, SEBI took over 17 years to add relatives and other persons who have relevant information, in the definition of 'insider'. To date, India has not made a single criminal conviction in insider trading cases. This is largely because India allows a compounding offence process which allows violators of insider trading to pay fines instead of going through the criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p><strong><em>How can India Improve?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Many have criticized SEBI for not utilizing its powers well enough to deal with insider trading in India. The main critique stems from the lack of criminal proceedings against those who violate insider trading norms. Section 24 of the SEBI Act states that if any person contravenes or attempts to contravene or abets the contravention of the provisions of the SEBI Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder, he can be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, which may extend to twenty-five crore rupees or with both. When this section is read with Regulation 3 of the Insider Trading Regulation, it makes insider trading a criminal offence. The imprisonment period in India is half of what the USA prescribes, but more than that of U.K.</p>\n<p>However, to date, there have been no criminal proceedings in the country. The main reason for this is perhaps the higher standard of proof that is required in a criminal proceeding. Having a criminal punishment alone will not prove to be successful. It is important that those committing insider trading see criminal action as a proper deterrent. Therefore the government must make provisions to relax the burden of proof on SEBI and implement other changes to make criminal proceedings against people easier. Further SEBI also needs to file for more criminal action as penalties are not proving to be enough.</p>\n<p>However, along with these SEBI also needs to evolve other policies. For example, a person is liable as a connected person only if he has been a connected person for six months prior to the act of insider trading. However, there is no such requirement in other jurisdictions such as U.K. By virtue of this time fixed period, people can easily circumvent the law.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, In India, SEBI is limited to regulating and dealing with listed companies. It must widen its scope and include unlisted companies under its purview too.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, SEBI is continuously evolving its rules and regulations. Thus, a slow yet steady change can be seen in limiting insider trading. In 2019 SEBI also <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/insider-trading-cases-sebi-comes-out-with-new-informant-mechanism-to-reward-whistleblowers/articleshow/72956132.cms\">introduced a mechanism</a> to reward whistleblowers and other informants for sharing information about insider trading cases[vii]. These changes illustrate the in recent years many new provisions have been initiated, now it is time to of the proper execution and implementation of the same.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>About the author: Tuhina Sahai is a 5<sup>th</sup> Year Student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>After the II world war, an interconnected and systematised global order was created. This world order remained intact to a large extent regardless of a few hiccups in the last 65 years. However, with political scientists predicting the rise of a more closed world and economists writing off globalisation, a shift from the old world order is inevitable. The recent pandemic acts as a catalyst to this. Countries are turning inwards and becoming authoritarian.</p>\n<p>For example, United States has been showing hostility towards multilateral trade, it <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterpham/2017/12/29/why-did-donald-trump-kill-this-big-free-trade-deal/#40ef48984e62\">withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP), a 12-nation trade deal,&nbsp;which was meant to increase United States’ influence over Asia-Pacific, while countering China’s growth. Even India refused to join the TPP, but the same will not have an adverse impact. In fact, Abhijit Das, head of the Centre for WTO studies have said that the TPP model might not be in the interest of India. According to him, provisions of TPP if applied will expose farmers to the risk of being knocked out of the market, while domestic industry may not be able to face import competition. Recently on May 29, the Trump administration declared that it would <a href=\"https://www.china-briefing.com/news/us-position-hong-kong-special-status-possible-implications/\">revoke Hong Kong’s special trade status</a> under the US laws. This will limit the entry of certain Chinese graduate students and researchers, Chinese firms would be closely examined and would be delisted if they did not comply with US laws. Also on May 26, the US formally announced its decision to leave the WHO. However, this “America first” approach didn’t work as the US had to turn to China, India and South Korea for medical supplies.</p>\n<p>The Chinese, on the other hand, are growing more aggressive to be the world power. The Chinese perspective is guided by three significant principles: GDP-ism <em>(stating that the most important logic is economic development)</em>, China-centrism <em>(China is the cultural, political or economic centre of world) </em>and China exceptionalism (China follows its own wisdom and doesn’t believe in learning from others).</p>\n<p><strong>Opportunity for a New World Order</strong></p>\n<p>With growing tensions between US and China and the two countries choosing distinct paths to recover from the pandemic, India can very well see this as an opportunity to unfold a new world order. Environment, healthcare, technology and democratic liberalism will be the foundations for the new world order. India can assume a significant job in building a world dependent on “human-centric development cooperation”. The <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-lockdown-pm-modis-address-to-the-nation-on-may-12-2020/article31566800.ece\">Prime Minister’s address</a> to the nation on May 12 also had the underlying message about making India Global and turning crisis into opportunity.</p>\n<p>For this, first, India should seize the opportunity to re-wire the global supply chains. As the world is blaming China for the pandemic, global companies are looking at shifting manufacturing from China to India and using India as a manufacturing export base. Half a month back, a <a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/2020/u-s-rep-gallagher-introduces-bill-to-end-u-s-dependence-on-chinese-manufactured-pharmaceuticals/\">bill</a> was introduced in the US Senate to permanently end US reliance on Chinese produced pharma in two years. A few European countries too issued a mandate to partner companies to decrease reliance on China to under 10% in the next two years.</p>\n<p>However, major reforms are needed to become a serious investment destination. The opportunity does not come up without any competition. A <a href=\"https://www.crisil.com/content/dam/crisil/our-analysis/reports/gr-a/archive/2016/10/IndiaInsights-October-2016.pdf\">2016 CRISIL study</a> pointed out that in the last decade, Vietnam and Bangladesh took up low-end manufacturing from China, while India lost its market share in global exports. The competition should be seen from the point of view of creating more job opportunities by expanding industries. The government and Indian companies could join hands to guarantee that the individuals that lose their jobs are available to MNCs hoping to move base into India and thus provide Indian companies and labour, immediate relief.</p>\n<p>Moreover, an empowered joint industry-government task force should be established to help build awareness about India as a sourcing destination. An Indian sourcing portal like Alibaba can be launched too. All this can be backed by some incentives given to exporters like credit support, subsidies and ensuring smoother and faster clearances.</p>\n<p><strong>India emerges as a World Leader </strong></p>\n<p>The role of the majority of regulatory bodies, including the United Nations and the WHO, has been inadequate. These bodies failed to guide the world on how to combat the virus effectively. This has led people to realise that the old framework in which authority in terms of global affairs is vested in just a couple, should change. There is no reason why India, the largest democracy with 1/6th of the total populace, not get its new place in the new world order. No nation should discredit a legitimate decision of the majority by practising its veto power.</p>\n<p><strong>Has G7 become defunct?</strong></p>\n<p>India has emerged as a powerful leader amidst the pandemic by demonstrating the world the value of ethics, sharing, honesty and most importantly integrity. The country, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has guided different nations including the regional forums like SAARC on dealing with the pandemic. India even requested a gathering of G-20, which the nations like USA, UK, Germany and Saudi Arabia promptly accepted. Even Jim O’Neill, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management who first coined the term BRIC, says that it’s “time up” for the G7 group of nations and that another G7 ought to be formed and the old G7 junked. According to him, the <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/jim-oneill-bric-inventor-says-g-7-irrelevant-as-china-and-india-left-out/1204208/\">new G7</a> should comprise of the US, the EU, Japan and the four BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China. The new G7 would account for 75% of global GDP. Interestingly, on 2 June, US President <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/06/trump-invites-india-modi-attend-g7-summit-200603073013954.html\">Donald Trump invited India</a> to join an expanded G7.</p>\n<p>Recently, during the Non-Aligned Movement<a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-sent-medicines-to-123-nations-pm-modi-at-nam-video-conference-on-covid-19-11588608862852.html\">(NAM) Summit</a> via video conferencing, Modi emphasised on the fact as to how we need a new framework of globalisation based on fairness, equality and humanity. International establishments that are increasingly illustrative of the present world with a focus on human welfare and not just economic growth can achieve the objective.</p>\n<p>Despite our own needs, India shared medical supplies including the drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with over 123 partner countries, including 59 members of NAM. This earned India the reverence and regard of the whole world. Even at the video conference among the 20 greatest economies of the world - G20, there was an impressive deal of spotlight on India. India was applauded for exceptionally managing the pandemic with a populace of over 1 billion, second, to only China’s. All this additionally resounds India’s developing position in the new world order. This was because in the initial weeks of April, India could curb the infection, but, after the lockdown was eased on 8 June 2020, India saw a surge in the infections. The nation surpassed UK to become the fourth-worst affected country. India needs to increase the number of tests whilst improving its healthcare infrastructure to again gain the trust of the citizens and ultimately the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Shift towards a Multipolar World</strong></p>\n<p>As indicated by <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/04/14/weo-april-2020\">IMF’s most recent global projection</a>, the post-coronavirus world economy is expected to dive into the worst recession since the great depression. The USA will have (-5.9%) negative development and Europe (-7.5%) negative development. The total estimated loss to the global GDP over 2020 and 2021 is over $9 trillion, which is more than the combined economy of Japan and Germany. India is among a couple of countries, which will have a positive GDP growth rate, estimated at 1.9 percent. It is the highest among G20 countries with China closely following at 1.6 percent. This will lead a path towards a state of “multipolarity” with India being one of the poles.</p>\n<p>The period after the Soviet Union collapsed was a “unipolar” period - a time when the United States was, and behaved like, the most powerful country in the world. Even before the pandemic, states were moving towards multipolarity, however, the crisis has accelerated the shift. The US-China relationship, which has always served as a pillar of the global economy will falter and the world will become more competitive with increased protectionism. Even the SAARC model will distort the current unipolar system with India working closely with its neighbouring states. India has always been an advocate of devolution of power away from the traditional powerhouses such as USA, Russia and China. With the SAARC countries working together and emerging as a strong regional bloc, it can influence other power players in regional blocs such as BRICS and ASEAN to follow in its footsteps. Not just India, but other countries will emerge soon. For example, a stronger and centralised EU will emerge, Russia will become a buffer zone between China and Europe and Turkey will look to turn into a predominant power in the Mediterranean.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, to work towards a multi-polar order, India’s way forward is either through participation in, or formation of, multilateral groupings. India’s commitment to multilateral associations has expanded since the finish of the Cold War. India is related with a few discussions, for example, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the East Asia Summit (EAS), the BRICS Summit, the Shanghai Co-activity Organisation, the G-20 Summit, the Mekong-Ganga Co-activity, the International Solar Alliance and so forth. India has additionally be related to forums such as the Commonwealth and the NAM for over 50 years.</p>\n<p><strong>India – a deserving candidate for a permanent seat at UNSC</strong></p>\n<p>India’s growing admiration and respect in the world and its commitment towards multilateral forums can help it gain a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) as well. Currently, the West, which is home just to 12% of the total populace, comprises 60% of the permanent membership in the UNSC. The UNSC is one of the most powerful body on matters of world harmony and security, including taking action against ill-behaving nations. As a significant racial and cultural group, a world civilisation, a supporter of world’s developments, and a significant 21<sup>st</sup>-century economy, India’s wisdom and its autonomous voice will provide a much-needed parity in world politics. Hence, it should have a permanent seat in the UNSC.</p>\n<p>Even Estonia, which entered UNSC as a non-permanent member for 2 years and was among nations to block the Chinese endeavours on Kashmir, supports India. Estonia’s Foreign Minister, Urmas Reinsalu recently called for UN reforms and <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/estonia-new-unsc-member-bats-for-indias-permanent-status/articleshow/73300884.cms\">expressed that India merits a permanent seat</a> on the UNSC. Barring China, the other 4 permanent members have also been in support of India getting a permanent seat at the UNSC. Backing for India has been expanding with several nations pushing that the current UNSC does not represent the geo-political realities of the 21st century.</p>\n<p>China has been the main country hindering India’s entrance by utilising its veto power. It has even used his veto power to block WTO resolutions to benefit itself. In the event that India is given a similar access, it could be a game-changer in terms of the shift in balance of power in world politics. India would be the ideal counter to check Chinese impact and force in the area. Germany, Brazil and South Africa are not reasonable alternatives at present and hence, India should get a permanent seat in a short period. With no other country willing to contest the Asia seat even China was forced to propose <a href=\"https://www.manifestias.com/2019/07/04/india-becomes-non-permanent-member-of-unsc/\">India as a temporary member</a> of the UNSC seat for two years, starting in 2021. India is sure to win the position and thereby take its first step in pushing efforts to reform the Security Council and seeking a permanent membership. If India gets included in the UNSC, it will reinforce India’s stature as a “moralistic force” for the developing states and help in making UNSC more democratic.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above stated, India needs to work towards specific goals in order to change the world order. Some of them are:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>India should turn into a significant industrial and technology power. Development of indigenous technologies should assume as significant a job as technology transfers from other nations. Foreign organisations must be urged to take an interest in India’s development but partnering with Indian-owned companies and innovation must be the primary criteria for who gets invited and boosted by the Indian system.</li>\n<li>Indians should keep a large portion of the advantages deriving from India’s development. Foreign fundings should be used for the development of infrastructure, while domestic funds should be utilised for the development of high-growth tech industry.</li>\n<li>The Indian rupee must be one of the world’s top four reserve currencies. This won’t just represent India’s economic significance to the world, but also bring about real economic benefits. It will likewise shield India from antagonistic activities from other countries like the imposition of sanctions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A new world order is inevitably looming on the horizon, so the only question remaining is when and will India seize this opportunity and make the best out of this crisis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>About the author :&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Tisha Chhaparia&nbsp;</strong>is an undergraduate student pursuing BBA LLB(Hons) at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Post the second world war, there was a consensus that all countries must work together to achieve equitable development on a global scale. The world became conscious of the need for a paradigm shift to international cooperation and transparency for a more peaceful future. This new understanding led to the rise of globalization and made the world interdependent. With the growth of Global governance, there was a parallel escalation of the Global Health governance to improve public wellbeing at large. The World Health Organisation (WHO) became the centrepiece of the Global Health governance as the most recognized and influential body in his regard. Over the years the WHO worked on maintaining public health, assisted governments to keep a check on the spread of infectious diseases, improve their healthcare systems etc. However, in 2003 the SARS outbreak underscored the inefficiency of Global Health Governance. The outbreak spurred WHO into action to formulate measures to fight epidemics.</p>\n<p><em>FAILURE OF GLOBAL BODIES IN CURBING COVID-19</em></p>\n<p>In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, international bodies, especially WHO have been criticized by many. The WHO had a lackadaisical attitude toward the impending epidemic. Due to this, U.S president, Donald Trump, criticized WHO for its inadequate response. Japan’s deputy prime minister,&nbsp;Taro Aso, also <a href=\"https://theprint.in/world/rename-who-as-chinese-health-organization-japan-slams-un-body-for-giving-into-chinas-spin/393961/\">questioned&nbsp;the lack of preparedness</a> and inadequate evaluation of the WHO.&nbsp; The failure of WHO to disseminate appropriate information about the pandemic costed many lives globally.</p>\n<p>The main&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/what-we-do\">objective of WHO</a>&nbsp;is to protect public health and help eradicate epidemics but it failed at accomplishing its main task of preventing this virus from spreading and affecting millions of people. The main allegation against WHO is that it compromised on its principal of neutrality as an international organisation by displaying leniency towards China. This acted as an obstruction in the early detection and control of the virus. During the early stages of the pandemic, International bodies also failed to heed to the warnings given by Taiwan, since again, on China’s insistence, they do not recognize it as an independent member. However, WHO not only ignored the early warnings but also did not conduct any independent research on the matter. Its official stance remained close to China’s version. WHO even supported China’s claim that the virus spreads from animals to humans and there is no human to human spread. This misinformation reduced the severity of the situation in the eyes of many world leaders, who, trusting the WHO, did not take the matter seriously. Furthermore, WHO neither questioned any of the reports it received nor acted diligently in understanding and explaining the gravity of the Coronavirus. Its lack of foresight was apparent when it did not declare Covid-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in January 2020.</p>\n<p>The effect of the pandemic, however, is not limited to the health aspect only. It has permeated into other socio-economic spheres of life, such as trade, occupation, agriculture, etc. Therefore, the failure of global health governance in curbing this pandemic early on also drastically affected the global economy. The WHO could have substantially reduced this effect, had it pushed China to be more transparent and proactive in its reports. China was able to use its strong position in international organizations to shrink away from its responsibility during the virus outbreak without facing consequences. This exposed a big weakness of WHO.</p>\n<p><em>DRAWBACKS OF THE GLOBAL HEALTH REGIME</em></p>\n<p>It did not come as a surprise to many that Global bodies such as WHO, were not able to stop the spread of the Coronavirus. International systems have various drawbacks, and the main one is their lack of funding. International organizations such as WHO largely get funded by their member states. WHO and other similar organizations have various developing nations as their members, which means that they heavily support agendas to bridge the gap between the developed and developing nations. However, most developed nations do not support these causes or make contributions as they do not see any tangible benefit for themselves. Due to this most of the funding for WHO comes from the World Bank. Most nations make donations voluntarily based on their need or for certain projects only. By 2000s, 80 % of the WHO’s budget depended on its donors.</p>\n<p>This dependence of the WHO on its member nations is a problem since the body can no longer work in a purely autonomous way. It will always tend to have a bias for its major budget contributors. This is perhaps why none of the global bodies questioned China in the wake of the Coronavirus. It is one of the five permanent members of the UN’s Security Council and one of the biggest contributors to WHO. It has an increasingly important role in international organizations and thus, able to influence these bodies.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, International Organisations wrongly assumed that outbreaks of diseases were mostly limited to developing or underdeveloped nations. Since these nations have poor sanitation and improper healthcare systems, it was presumed that they were the more likely breeding grounds for infections and diseases. This assumption of the global bodies turned out to be disastrous. They did not monitor other nations and their varied conditions. So, when the Coronavirus broke out in China, there was no international surveillance to be able to identify the virus early on.</p>\n<p>Another drawback of international bodies is that they work mainly through state cooperation. This means that the organizations work mostly as advisory organs through domestic governments and institutions. However, it is the government of the country that has to take the actual steps to improve healthcare, etc. Therefore, WHO intervenes when there is a need for immediate action, but it does not work to improve the basic healthcare framework or institutions of a particular country. Because of this, most developing countries lack the basic infrastructure to deal with a pandemic, especially as extreme as the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p><em>HAVE GLOBAL BODIES BECOME REDUNDANT?</em></p>\n<p>The advent of Coronavirus Disease of 2019 or COVID-19 brought out an unusual impediment in front of the international bodies. The virus has spread wide and fast, infecting thousands per day. Unlike most viruses, it is also spread by patients showing mild or no symptoms, which makes it harder to track and control. Due to this, the effect of Covid-19 has been widespread and extremely dire in nature. <a href=\"https://www.who.int/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf\">Article 2</a> of the Constitution of the WHO lays down the functions of the WHO and on assessing the present situation, there is no doubt that it has failed to execute some of these duties. This has led many to question the very need for international organizations such as WHO, when they have failed at living up to their objectives.</p>\n<p>Most international organizations survive on international cooperation and collaboration. However, the COVID pandemic has made it clear that these organizations are not able to ensure absolute cooperation and collaboration amongst nations. The main example of this comes from the aftermath of the SARS outbreak, which also originated in China. It had also seen a delay in reporting, and the WHO had warned China of the consequence of such delays. Following this, China had agreed to work towards bettering the situation and had also committed to it by adding this in its laws. However, when cases of Coronavirus started appearing, the Chinese government still did not report this and even tried to hide crucial information. Therefore, international bodies could not make China cooperate or increase transparency in its actions or stop the spread of the virus by conduction independent research. This clearly points to the fact that global bodies lack the grit, resolution, resources and mechanisms to fulfil their objectives.</p>\n<p>However, deeming these global bodies and organizations to be redundant or superfluous isn’t fair either. The multilateral system works on compromise and none of the international bodies can be expected to achieve their goals without having flaws. Setting such a standard for global bodies is unrealistic and more likely a utopian dream. Therefore, while the current international system has its loopholes, eliminating these bodies altogether will leave behind a lacuna which might make such a situation even worse. In the absence of international bodies, global coordination will prove to be much more difficult. Today’s society faces issues such as the Climate Change crisis, Globalization of Trade, International security etc, which require global cooperation now, more than before.&nbsp; Afterall, even though their response was slow, they still undertook crucial steps to educate the world about the virus. WHO took notice of the virus and released an advisory on dealing with the virus in early January 2020. Since it realized the seriousness of the virus, it has been constantly warning countries and declared Covid-19 a global public health emergency. WHO did show a slight delay in declaring this, but this was because they did not wish to create mass hysteria and fear amongst people, based on half-baked knowledge, as had been the case during the Ebola outbreak.</p>\n<p>Further importance of the international bodies lies in the fact that the world will always need a body of experts and specialists to give reliable and homogenous information during an emergency, which everyone can follow. We cannot deny the way WHO and other bodies have undertaken efforts to streamline research work during this pandemic. They have been able to help collaborate efforts of all countries to work towards funding and finding a cure for the virus. Without such a body, each country would be expected to do independent research, which would prove to be time-consuming and potentially fatal for many.</p>\n<p>No system is perfect, but we don’t discard the entire system. The approach is to make the system better rather than scrapping the established set up. Creating a new system may also result in a similar situation, fraught with bureaucratic and diplomatic hurdles. It will also act as an economic burden for its member nations.&nbsp; It is more prudent to trust the existing bodies since they have managed to pass the test of time. However, profound structural changes must be made in global bodies. It is important to create more autonomous bodies who can work in a truly global manner and are immune to prejudices and political pressure from member countries. Funding of global bodies also needs to be done in a manner that gives these bodies more independence. Lastly, a system of checks and balances needs to be strengthened against these global bodies. Their activities must be monitored strictly, and they should be held accountable for all their follies and mishaps. Therefore, the way forward is, through mending the loopholes in the existing global bodies and working together for better preparedness in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/profile/kate-mayberry.html\">Kate Mayberry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/profile/mersiha-gadzo.html\">Mersiha Gadzo</a> &amp; Usaid Siddiqui, US attacks WHO for 'failure' to curb coronavirus, Aljazeera,&nbsp; 19th May 2020, available at <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/selfie-snapping-bolsonaro-defies-coronavirus-advice-live-updates-200517231736683.html\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/selfie-snapping-bolsonaro-defies-coronavirus-advice-live-updates-200517231736683.html</a></li>\n<li>Revathi Krishnan, Rename WHO as Chinese Health Organization: Japan slams UN body for ‘giving into China’s spin’, The Print, 2<sup>nd</sup> April, 2020 available at <a href=\"https://theprint.in/world/rename-who-as-chinese-health-organization-japan-slams-un-body-for-giving-into-chinas-spin/393961/\">https://theprint.in/world/rename-who-as-chinese-health-organization-japan-slams-un-body-for-giving-into-chinas-spin/393961/</a></li>\n<li>Objectives of WHO, World Health Organisation, available at <a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/what-we-do\">https://www.who.int/about/what-we-do</a></li>\n<li>Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), 16-24<sup>th</sup>&nbsp; February 2020, World Health Organisation, available at <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\">https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf</a></li>\n<li>Rajkamal Rao, Covid-19 is a massive failure of public health leadership, Business Line, 31st&nbsp; Mar 2020, available at <a href=\"https://bloncampus.thehindubusinessline.com/columns/world-view/covid-19-is-a-massive-failure-of-public-health-leadership/article31220809.ece\">https://bloncampus.thehindubusinessline.com/columns/world-view/covid-19-is-a-massive-failure-of-public-health-leadership/article31220809.ece</a></li>\n<li>Lawrence Freedman, How the World Health Organisation’s failure to challenge China over coronavirus cost us dearly,5<sup>th</sup> April 2020, available at <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/asia/2020/04/how-world-health-organisation-s-failure-challenge-china-over-coronavirus-cost-us\">https://www.newstatesman.com/world/asia/2020/04/how-world-health-organisation-s-failure-challenge-china-over-coronavirus-cost-us&nbsp;</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>About the author :</p>\n<p>Tuhina Sahai is a 5th Year Student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Internet has its profound influence on modem business practices, especially intellectual property, is unmistakable. Unlike in the brick-and-mortar world where consumers purchase products and services in physical stores and thus have clear context as to where, what, and from whom they are purchasing, online consumers have far fewer certain indicators of origin. Accordingly, online consumers must, to a large extent, rely on trademarks and other forms of brand recognition to identify specific goods and those responsible for their manufacture. As the number of global Internet users continues to rise, the need for corporations to maintain an online presence has similarly increased. Growing numbers of businesses have become entirely Internet-based. Accordingly, trademarks serve as uniquely important identifiers in the online environment.</p>\n<p>Under the Indian Trademarks Act,1999 as soon as a domain name become a business identifier to the source of the business its given trademark protection. Though the protection to domain names have not been given explicitly under the Act when acquired secondary meaning these domain names have been given trademark protection.</p>\n<p>The domain name has become the real estate of the Internet, and for the domainers make money from buying, parking and selling them. Web domain names represent the gateway to Internet connections and access to specific websites. With the growth of commercial activity on the internet, a domain name can be said to be used as a business identifier image also. Their value depends on several parameters, as Web traffic or search engines, and is typically calculated with \" quick and dirt \" algorithms freely available on the Web. The value of a web domain depends on its capacity to attract traffic, i.e. visitors, and to transform them into cash-generating customers.</p>\n<p>Internet domain names have an immense market of their own. The world saw a new change in the field of communications has created endless new opportunities for the citizens of cyberspace. The growing importance on the internet has fermented it into a powerful tool for businesses to promote, advertise, and sell products and services. Unfortunately, cybersquatting and domain name monetization which is the outcome of dishonest and unlawful conduct has also increased and has to be regulated by law now.</p>\n<p>According to ICANN, domain name monetization is a new exploitation tool with domain name registrars which is deﬁned as generating revenue from domain names.&nbsp; The registries that maintain the authoritative database for each top-level domain (e.g., .AERO, .COM, and .ORG) generate revenue, as do the registrars and resellers that charge a fee to those who register domain names.&nbsp; But the practices that are usually referred to as monetization refer to ways of using domain names to generate income.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three of these methods – pay per click, parking, and tasting – are described here.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong>An overview of Cybersquatting</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What is Cybersquatting?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price. The term is derived from \"squatting\", which is the act of occupying an abandoned or unoccupied space or building that the squatter does not own, rent, or otherwise have permission to use.</p>\n<p>The practise that's come to be known as cybersquatting originated at a time when most businesses were not savvy about the commercial opportunities on the Internet. Some entrepreneurial souls registered the names of well-known companies as domain names, with the intent of selling the names back to the companies when they finally woke up. Panasonic, Fry's Electronics, Hertz and Avon were among the \"victims\" of cybersquatters. Opportunities for cybersquatters are rapidly diminishing because most businesses now know that nailing down domain names is a high priority.</p>\n<p>Cybersquatting, however, is a bit different in that the domain names that are being \"squatted\" are (sometimes but not always) is being paid for through the registration process by the cybersquatters. Cybersquatters usually ask for prices far greater than that at which they purchased it. Some cybersquatters put up derogatory remarks about the person or company the domain is meant to represent to encourage the subject to buy the domain from them. Others post paid links via advertising networks to the actual site that the user likely wanted, thus monetizing their squatting.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1.1 What You Can Do to Fight a Cybersquatter</strong></p>\n<p>A victim of cybersquatting in the United States has the following two options and in the rest of the word only ICANN procedure:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong>sue under the provisions of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), or</strong></li>\n<li><strong>use an international arbitration system created by the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Trademark experts consider the ICANN arbitration system to be faster and less expensive than suing under the ACPA, and the procedure does not require an attorney.</p>\n<p><strong>Using the ICANN Procedure</strong></p>\n<p>In 1999, ICANN adopted and began implementing the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (<a href=\"https://www.icann.org/udrp/\">UDNDRP</a>), a policy for the resolution of domain name disputes. This international policy results in an arbitration of the dispute, not litigation. An action can be brought by any person who complains (referred to by ICANN as the \"complainant\") that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights</li>\n<li>the domain name owner has no rights or legitimate interests in the domain name, and</li>\n<li>the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these elements must be established for the complainant to prevail. If the complainant prevails, the domain name will be cancelled or transferred to the complainant. However, financial remedies are not available under the UDNDRP. I nformation about initiating a complaint is provided at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.icann.org/\">ICANN website</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Suing Under the ACPA</strong></p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t13t16+1523+1++%28Anticybersquatting%20Consumer%20Protection%20Act%29\">Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act</a>&nbsp;(ACPA) authorizes a trademark owner to sue an alleged cybersquatter in federal court and obtain a court order transferring the domain name back to the trademark owner. In some cases, the cybersquatter must pay money damages.</p>\n<p>To stop a cybersquatter, the trademark owner must prove all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the domain name registrant had a bad-faith intent to profit from the trademark</li>\n<li>the trademark was distinctive at the time the domain name was first registered</li>\n<li>the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to the trademark, and</li>\n<li>the trademark qualifies for protection under federal trademark laws -- that is, the trademark is distinctive and its owner was the first to use the trademark in commerce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Defences to ACPA lawsuits.</strong></p>\n<p>If the accused cybersquatter demonstrates that he had a reason to register the domain name other than to sell it back to the trademark owner for a profit, then a court will probably allow him to keep the domain name.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Domain Name basics</strong></li>\n</ol>\nA domain name is your website name. A domain name is an address where Internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.<br>\nA domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in combination of the various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more.\n<p>Domain names under generic Top-Level Domain Names (gTLDs) may be registered with one of more than two thousand&nbsp;ICANN-accredited registrars, or their resellers. Registrars are accredited by&nbsp;ICANN&nbsp;organization and certified by the registries to sell domain names. They are bound by the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA) with&nbsp;ICANN&nbsp;organization, and by their agreements with the registries. Resellers are organizations affiliated with or under are under contract with registrars to sell domain names and other services offered by the registrar such as web hosting or email mailboxes. Resellers are bound by their agreements with the registrars whose services they sell and are not accredited by&nbsp;the ICANN&nbsp;organization. The registrars remain responsible and accountable for all domain names sold by their resellers.&nbsp;ICANN&nbsp;organization maintains a list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.icann.org/registrar-reports/accredited-list.html\">current&nbsp;ICANN-accredited registrars</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Cybersquatting Test</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Rule 4(a) as devised by the UDRP mentions applicable disputes in the events wherein:</p>\n<p>1. The domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and</p>\n<p>2. There are no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and</p>\n<p>3. The domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith. Rule 4(b) explains the evidence of the registration and Bad Faith use. This is also known as the 'cybersquatting test’.</p>\n<p>Although the policy requires proof of all these three elements, in practice, the complainant will establish trademark or common law rights in the domain name, and generally, that the registrant operated in bad faith.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong>ICANN Approach</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>ICANN implemented the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) in 1999, which has been used to resolve more than 20,000 disputes over the rights to domain names. The UDRP is designed to be efficient and cost-effective. In 2010 alone around 2696 cybersquatting cases were filed with the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Centre under this Policy involving 4370 domain names across 57 countries, according to WIPO‟s official website. The UDRP is designed to solve disputes which usually arise when a registrant has registered a domain name identical or confusingly similar to the trademark with no rights or legitimate interests in the name and has registered and used the domain name in bad faith Conflicts between two trademark holders or between a trademark holder and a registrant with rights or legitimate interests are not the concern for UDRP. Particularly, the UDRP does not apply if the registrant has been known by the name, has used it in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services, or has used it for a legitimate noncommercial purpose.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Domain Name Monetization</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>As discussed above&nbsp; Domain name monetization if deﬁned broadly refers to ways of generating revenue from domain names. They can be of following types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Affiliate Websites&nbsp;– Think of a good domain name, register it, and then build a website filled with various advertisements for other sites that bear a similarity to your domain name, making money off anyone who clicks on the ads and purchases the advertised products.</li>\n<li>PPC Websites (Pay-Per-Click)&nbsp;– These are very much like affiliate sites, except the revenue generated comes from PPC advertising systems like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.google.com/adsense/\">Google AdSense</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://publisher.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo Publisher Network</a>.</li>\n<li>Domain Parking&nbsp;– There are several services, like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sedo.com/\">sedo.com</a>, where you can “park” your domain. The domain will have a variety of keyword-targeted ads, similar to the PPC and affiliate sites mentioned above. You make money off the ads that your parking company puts up. Additionally, you can also list your site for sale at the same time.</li>\n<li>Domain Leasing&nbsp;– Rent the domain name out to advertisers or other interested parties.</li>\n<li>Domain Purchase and Resale&nbsp;– Register a domain or buy an existing domain with hopes of reselling it to other domainers.</li>\n<li>Domain Development&nbsp;– Register a domain name and develop a website for it, with unique content and some sort of business model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With domain names like Insure.com selling for $16 million, it is clear that the value of the online real estate has increased dramatically. Cybersquatters all over the world are registering domain names in bulk, a presumably easy way to ensure a quick profit. Rightsholders are, therefore, increasingly resorting to dispute resolution mechanisms to recover domain names. Domain name disputes about a generic top-level domain (gTLD) name are governed by the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP). These disputes are entertained by a dispute resolution service provider approved by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), such as the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and National Arbitration Forum (NAF).</p>\n<p>A domain name dispute concerning the country code TLD (ccTLD) name for India (.in) is governed by the.IN Dispute Resolution Policy (INDRP) and is overseen by the National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI).</p>\n<p>While the INDRP and the UDRP follow similar procedures, the INDRP remains unique and is distinct from the UDRP. The most significant difference lies in the three criteria which a complainant must satisfy under the respective policies, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The domain name must be similar to the complainant’s trademark;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The domain that is in question must be identical to or confusingly similar to a name, trademark or service mark in which you have rights. Note that this can cover unregistered trademarks such as names of the personalities well-known.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The registrant must not have rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The registrant must not have any legitimate right or interest of his own in the questioned domain name. Legitimate use is roughly when the domain name is being used (or being planned to be used) in connection with a bona fide offering of goods and services before the registrant of the trademark is aware of such a dispute.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The domain name must be registered and/or used in bad faith.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The questioned domain must have been registered and used in evil faith. Both these essentials of bad faith must be demonstrated. The UDRP has set out a non- exhaustive list of what institutes bad faith. These consist of&nbsp;diverting users to other sites by creating a possibility of confusion;&nbsp;if the registrant has numerous domains registered;&nbsp;a method made to a party that would be interested in the domain demanding money or its worth significantly in excess of out of pocket expenditures;&nbsp;passive holding of a domain was held to establish bad faith if the impression that the domain was being open for sale was given and boards are progressively concluding that the domains are being held for sale;&nbsp;offering to sell the domain on an auction site has been interpreted as being in bad faith; however, on instances, the fact that a registrant has offered to trade the domain by auction, or accepted to negotiate a price when communicated about the dispute does not automatically establish bad faith for the purposes of UDRP;&nbsp;being tough to interact or undetectable has been interpreted as bad faith.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Difference between Indian Domain Name Dispute Resolution and ICANN Domain Name Dispute Resolution</strong></li>\n<li>The first difference is that under the INDRP, the absence of the conjunctive phrase “and” between the first and second element suggests that to succeed, a complainant may simply satisfy the first element. Alternatively, the complainant may satisfy the second and third element (which are conjoined with the phrase “and”) and not the first. However, under the UDRP, the complainant is expressly required to satisfy all three elements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, such a literal interpretation of the elements prescribed under the INDRP can have disastrous ramifications. This can be seen with a disjunctive reading of the elements which implies that a complainant can obtain a remedy against a registrant who has legitimate rights in a domain name which is registered and used in good faith, solely under its similarity to the complainant’s trademark. As a corollary, if a complainant can prove that the registrant has no legitimate interest in the domain name and that it was registered or used in bad faith, the disjunctive interpretation implies that the domain name needn’t be similar to a trademark in which the complainant has rights. However, in such an event, the complainant may not have any locus standi to submit the complaint in the first place. It must be kept in mind that the object of the INDRP is to counter cybersquatting, for which a complainant must satisfy all three elements while seeking a remedy under the INDRP. Therefore, the elements must be interpreted conjunctively.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The second difference is that under the UDRP, a complainant must prove that the domain name is registered and being used in bad faith. However, under the INDRP under the disjunctive requirement of the phrase “or”, the complainant is required to prove that the domain name has been registered or is being used in bad faith. The significance of this is that if a complainant proves that the domain name was registered but not used in bad faith or vice-versa, the complainant will be unable to obtain a remedy under the UDRP, but can do so under the INDRP.</li>\n<li><strong>Indian Judicial trend towards Cybersquatting</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Under the Indian trademarks act, 1999 two types of remedy for cybersquatting have been made available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Passing Off</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Infringement</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first case that came in this regards was<em>Yahoo! Inc. v. Akash Arora &amp; Ors</em>; in which an endeavour was made to utilize the domain name for Internet-related administrations as against domain name. In this case, the defendant launched a website nearly identical to the plaintiff renowned website and also provided similar services. Here the court ruled in favour of trademark rights of U.S. based Yahoo. Inc (the Plaintiff) and against the defendant, that had registered itself as YahooIndia.com. The Court observed that it was an effort to trade on the fame of yahoo’s trademark. The court further added that a domain name registrant does not obtain any legal right to use that particular domain name simply because he has registered the domain name, he could still be liable for trademark infringement.</p>\n<p>In <em>Tata Sons Limited and An Vs design ID Limited&nbsp; </em>&nbsp;the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi Court held that \"The utilization of the same or comparable domain name may prompt redirection of clients which could come about because of such clients erroneously getting to one domain name rather than another. This may happen in online business with its quick advance and moment (and the suggestively boundless) openness to clients and potential clients and especially so in territories of particular cover. Customary consumers/clients looking to find the capacities accessible under one domain name might be confounded on the off chance that they unintentionally touched base at an alternate however comparable site which offers no such administrations. Such clients could well presume that the primary domain name proprietor had misspoken to its products or administrations through its limited-time activities and the principal domain proprietor would in this manner lose their client. It is clear therefore that a domain name may have every one of the characteristics of a trademark and could found an action for passing off\"</p>\n<p>Also in the case of<em> Starbucks corporation v. Mohanraj</em>&nbsp;(Decided on 26<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Nov 2009) the respondent's domain name&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.starbucks.co.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.starbucks.co.in</a>&nbsp;was confusingly similar to the complainant's domain name&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.starbuscks.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.starbuscks.in</a>., it was contended that the domain name of the respondent is identical and confusingly similar to the complainant's domain name. it was also contended that the respondent has no legitimate interest in the domain name. Further, it was contended that the mark was used by the respondent in bad faith.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The learned arbitrator held that the disputed domain name was confusing, similar and identical to the complainant and that they had right in the trademark. The respondent had registered the domain name in bad faith and so the domain name should be transferred to the complainant</p>\n<p>In <em>Bloomberg Finance L.P., (BF) vs. Mr. Kanhan Vijay</em>, the domain name in question was www.bloomberg.net.in which was registered by Bloomberg Finance L.P. which was also the registered proprietor of the services mark BLOOMBERG in India and abroad, with rights from 1986 as a trademark, trade name and corporate identity establishing widespread reputation and goodwill. The complainant had registered various domain names incorporating \"Bloomberg\" as the name and therefore was the prior adopter, user and registrant, although it had no reason to adopt or register www.bloomberg.net.in as domain name. The respondent’s bad faith intent was established by the Panel stating that there was a lack of due diligence or evidence on the part of the respondent towards their claims and that the domain was to be transferred to the complainant accordingly.</p>\n<p>In the case of&nbsp;<em>GOOGLE Inc. v. Gulshan Khatri</em>(Decided on 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;May 2011). The complainant filed the instant complaint challenging the registration of the domain name&nbsp;in favour of the respondent the grievance of the complainant was regarding the latter's act of adopting identical and identical domain name and that also in respect of similar services of the respondent.</p>\n<p>The learned arbitrator held that the impugned domain name&nbsp;was identical and confusingly to the other prior registered domain name and registered trademark of the complainant and directed the registry to cancel the said domain name forthwith and transfer the said domain name in favour of the complainant.</p>\n<p>In 2018, October 10 the.INDRP has retrained the respondent from using the domain name&nbsp;and transfer the domain name in favour of the complainant.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conclusion</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus looking at the aforementioned issues and case laws, the author has realised that there is a great for India to revise its law-making body to accommodate digital crouching and cybersquatting related disputes in the Information Technology Act 2000 and the Cyber Appellate Tribunal ought to be utilized for such offences also. In India, due to the absence of relevant cyber laws, cases are decided within the ambit of trademark laws by interpreting the principle of Passing off concerning domain names in the court and by the.IN dispute resolution policy in India. On account of the problems Indian jurisdiction faced and the various jurisdictions looked into there is an urgent need to draft new legislation in India which would expressly deal with cybersquatting and domain name disputes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong>:</p>\n<p>Kitika Singh is currently working as an Assistant Professor at National Law University Jodhpur.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>We celebrate May 1 as labour day as a tribute to working men and women. In contrast, in May, a few states in India curbed labor rights through an amendment in the labor laws as part of the campaign to make India self-reliant (Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan). The labor reforms are portrayed as essential to attract foreign investment, and boost the Indian economy in the background of the COVID pandemic.</p>\n<p>These reforms are also expected to give a boost to the “Make in India” campaign if foreign companies were to set up factories in India due to abundant labour at cheap cost. Recently, India jumped 14 places in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business 2020 survey to stand at 63, among 190 countries. But should “Ease of Doing Business” justify human right violations? Should it justify damaging the health of people? Should it be allowed to dilute the labour laws and de-humanise labours on whose strength the economy strives?</p>\n<p>Rajasthan has amended Industrial Disputes Act 1947 to increase the threshold limit for lay-offs and retrenchment to 300 from 100 earlier. In Maharashtra, shops and factories no longer have to submit multiple returns under various labour laws but one consolidated annual return. The Factories Act 1948 has been amended in 3 states (Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat) to increase the work time to 12 hours every day and 72 hours every week, compared to 8 hours every day and 48 hours every week. Except for the following legislations, the UP government has suspended all labour laws:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Building and Other Construction Workers Act, 1996</li>\n<li>Workmen Compensation Act, 1923</li>\n<li>Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976; and</li>\n<li>Provisions related to Children and Women in the labour legislations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What is worrisome is the varying length of suspension of these labour rights-which vary from 1,000 days in Madhya Pradesh to three years in Uttar Pradesh. Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh have restricted labor rights for a short-term (2-3 months), in the background of COVID situation. However, U.P suspended labor rights for three years justifying on the grounds of the pandemic. Does the Constitution allow for such extreme measures? Why wasn’t the draft circulated in the public before the amendments were introduced?</p>\n<p>Even then the policy may prove to be futile as investors need policy stability, predictability and consistency before investing and a three year window might not give enough concession as it could easily take anything between 18 to 24 months to set up a factory and get all licenses and authorisations. Predictable environment is crucial for any private investor before committing their money, so for instance, a home buyer may not invest in a flat even if it offered at dirt-cheap prices with additional benefits if there is no guarantee as to the time of its completion.</p>\n<p>Following these, other states of India might also do away with the Labour laws in the near future however it is only West Bengal’s Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who has criticised the BJP-ruled states for bringing about such changes to labour regulations stating that they are jeopardising workers’ job security. She has further clarified that the key to revive the state’s economy lies in strengthening the infrastructure of rural Bengal.</p>\n<p>Contrary to this, the Indian Staffing Federation(ISF) has welcomed the decisions of various states to suspend multiple labour law provisions. ISF’s President Lohit Bhatia said in a statement \"India has been lagging in simplifying its labour laws for nearly 70 years, though the government did try and bring about legislation in past three years to reduce over 44 labour laws to four labour codes, the current set of announcements by the state governments will be more likely to achieve the results.” However, the decision has been taken without any discussion and thereby defying the democratic procedure which needs to be followed in a democratic country.</p>\n<p><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></p>\n<p>Labour comes under the concurrent list under the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution, which mean that both the Centre as well as State can make laws under this subject. This means that the State cannot completely suspend Central laws. U.P has suspended for three years the central laws like the Minimum Wages Act, the Payment of Wages Act, and the Payment of Bonus Act. Under the Constitution, the Government is allowed to promulgate an ordinance if there is an exigency, and meeting of the state assembly or Parliament is not possible. However, the respective state legislature must approve such ordinance within six months of its promulgation.</p>\n<p>Article 254(2) of the Constitution stipulates the procedure to be followed in case the bill enacted by a state legislature on a subject matter in the concurrent list violates the Union Law on the same subject. The bill mentioned above needs the approval of the President for it to transform into an act. If not, the bill is void to the extent it violates the Union laws. This procedure has not been followed yet.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as opposed to urging labourers to return by securing wages and improving working conditions, the changes presented by the States are taking away the most basic labour law protections. Article 23 of the Indian Constitution prohibits trafficking in Human beings and forced labour. The word “begar” in the said provision denotes a form of forced labour under which a person is compelled to work without receiving any remuneration. Even though wages will be paid on time under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 which will still be in force, the amount would not be in tune with the Minimum Wages Act and Rules. The motivation behind the ordinance is to encourage industries to freely employ the enormous number of migrant workers that have returned without going through the normal process of employing them. Due to vast unemployment, these workers will be willing to take up jobs at meagre wages which is nothing but a form of beggary. The Supreme Court in <strong><em>People’s Union for Democratic Rights and Ors. v. Union of India</em></strong><a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><strong><em><sup>[1]</sup></em></strong></a> has held that \"To contend that&nbsp; exacting labour&nbsp; by&nbsp; passing some remuneration, though&nbsp; it be&nbsp; inadequate will not attract the provisions of <a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1071750/\">Article 23</a> is to unduly restrict the amplitude of the prohibition against forced labour enacted in Article 23. The contention is not only ill-founded, but&nbsp; does not accord with the principle enunciated by this Court in <strong><em>Maneka Gandhi v . Union of India</em></strong><a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> that when interpreting the provisions&nbsp; of the Constitution conferring fundamental rights, the attempt of the Court should be to expand the reach and ambit of the fundamental rights rather than to attenuate their meaning and content.” Hence, there is no logic in attracting Article 23 only in cases where no remuneration is paid to the workers for the work received but not when inadequate remuneration is paid. Even in <strong><em>Sanjit Roy v. State of Rajasthan</em></strong><a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><strong><em><sup>[3]</sup></em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong>the Apex court ruled that the fundamental right enshrined in Article 23 is violated by non-payment of minimum wage.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, the Supreme Court clarified that the rights and benefits conferred on the workmen employed by a contractor under the provisions of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970 and the Inter State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979 are clearly intended to ensure basic human dignity to the workmen and if the workmen are deprived of any of these rights and benefits to which they are entitled under the provisions of these two pieces of social welfare legislation, that would clearly be a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>The May 7, 2020 gas release occurrence at the Visakhapatnam polymer factory, LG Polymers India Pvt. which is an ongoing crisis has left in excess of 300 individuals in hospitals. Right to health of workmen has been recognised as part of the right to life under Article 21.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> However, the suspension for Factories Act, 1948 which provides for fire safety rules, facilities for first aid, regulation of hazardous processes and waste management, etc will leave these workers remediless and will also violate their right to life.</p>\n<p>A lot of other Fundamental Rights as well as Directive Principles of State Policy(DPSPs) are violated on account of the abrogation of labour rights. These rights and principles lay the foundation of labour rights, conditions under which they can be made to work and the responsibility of both Central and State Governments toward the labour class. For example, the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(c) to form associations, including a trade union will be taken away by suspending the Trade Unions Act, 1926. The DPSPs even though unenforceable are constitutionally-mandated goals, for example Article 43 gives the Government the responsibility “to secure to all workers a living wage, conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life.” All the same, it is unclear whether the abrogation of the labour laws will benefit the industry or attract FDI as speculated by the Government. In such an event, this is a well-suited opportunity for both Governments to renew their commitments to the DPSPs.</p>\n<p><strong>ILO AND ABOLITION OF LABOUR LAWS</strong></p>\n<p>International Labour Organisation(ILO) has asked the concerned authorities to ensure that the relaxations adhere to the global standards. The amendments should come as a result of a tripartite consultation involving the government, the workers’ and the employers’ organisations. Finally, they should be consistent with the International Labour Standards, including the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (FPRW) (adopted by India in 1998). It is well settled that “the provisions of the Treaties/Conventions which are not contrary to Municipal laws, be deemed to have been incorporated in the domestic law.”<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Hence, international labour standards ratified by India cannot be violated as it forms part of the domestic law of the country. The FPRW makes it clear that the rights enshrined under it are applicable to all States-regardless of the level of economic development.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>\n<p>Ten Central Trade Unions on 11 May 2020, said that they are considering approaching the ILO against the decision to abrogate major labour laws in some states. The Unions consider these moves as gross violation of the following ILO Conventions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Right to Freedom of Association</li>\n<li>Rights to Collective Bargaining</li>\n<li>Internationally accepted norms of eight hour working day</li>\n<li>Tripartite Consultation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Over and above this, in a joint statement the Central Trade Unions has also threatened to call for a nationwide agitation to protest against such moves by the State Governments.</p>\n<p>A petition has also been filed in the Supreme Court of India on 20 May 2020 challenging the constitutional validity of the said decision taken by various States. The petitioner contends that a Central law cannot be suspended by the state without due procedure and that the Factories Act even though can be diluted, it can be done only in case of a public emergency and such a situation has not yet arisen. Also, this arbitrary move has opened up room for sheer exploitation of labours in a time when a two square meal a day is a luxury for them. The judicial decision on the same is much awaited.</p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\n<p>Regulating laws and changing certain policies is one thing but suspending the major labour laws with utter disregard to humanitarian grounds while flouting even international norms is like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It is fascinating to note that while Indian States are attempting to suspend labour security and making it simpler for employers to hire and fire employees as per their whims and fancies, numerous other countries are attempting to limit lay-offs in this time of emergency by giving wage subsidy to employers to induce the workers on the payroll. One such example is of Canada which has introduced an emergency wage subsidy scheme which will provide a subsidy of 75% of the eligible remuneration paid by an eligible entity (eligible employer) to each employee – to a maximum of $847 per week. As mentioned earlier, the policy of suspending labour rights to attract foreign investors by reducing labour costs might prove to be futile unless there is certainty and stability. Hence, scrapping of almost all labour legislations is not the answer but a regulatory mechanism and the need to amend the outdated labour laws is the way. For example, if flexibility is to be given to employers in recruiting and terminating, it can be combined with a reasonable scheme of unemployment compensation in which both employers and employees consistently contribute. There needs to be maintained a balance between the need of firms/industries and workers’ employment security.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>REFERENCES:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The World Bank, Ease of Doing Business Rankings, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings\">https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings</a></li>\n<li>Financial Express, India Moves Big Labour Laws, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/labour-reforms-laws-rules-change-uttar-pradesh-up-madhya-pradesh-rajasthan-himachal-pradesh-punjab-kerala-coronavirus-reforms/1952023/\">https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/labour-reforms-laws-rules-change-uttar-pradesh-up-madhya-pradesh-rajasthan-himachal-pradesh-punjab-kerala-coronavirus-reforms/1952023/</a></li>\n<li>The Hindu, Labour Rights are in Free fall, Available at: <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/labour-laws-suspension-by-states-to-pull-businesses-out-of-crisis-isf/articleshow/75674928.cms?from=mdr\">https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/labour-laws-suspension-by-states-to-pull-businesses-out-of-crisis-isf/articleshow/75674928.cms?from=mdr</a></li>\n<li>The Statesman, Bengal Won’t change Labour Laws amid Pandemic like BJP-ruled states, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.thestatesman.com/india/bengal-wont-change-labour-laws-amid-pandemic-like-bjp-ruled-states-mamata-banerjee-1502888299.html\">https://www.thestatesman.com/india/bengal-wont-change-labour-laws-amid-pandemic-like-bjp-ruled-states-mamata-banerjee-1502888299.html</a></li>\n<li>The Economic Times, Labour Laws Suspension by States to pull businesses out of crisis: ISF, Available at: <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/labour-laws-suspension-by-states-to-pull-businesses-out-of-crisis-isf/articleshow/75674928.cms?from=mdr\">https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/labour-laws-suspension-by-states-to-pull-businesses-out-of-crisis-isf/articleshow/75674928.cms?from=mdr</a></li>\n<li>The Wire, Ensure That Changes to Indian Labour Laws Adhere to Global Standards: ILO, Available at: <a href=\"https://thewire.in/labour/ilo-india-labour-laws-covid-19\">https://thewire.in/labour/ilo-india-labour-laws-covid-19</a></li>\n<li>International Labour Organisation, ILO Declaration on FPRW, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/declaration/lang--en/index.htm\">https://www.ilo.org/declaration/lang--en/index.htm</a></li>\n<li>ILO Convention 87, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312232\">https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312232</a></li>\n<li>ILO Convention 98, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312243\">https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312243</a></li>\n<li>C001 and C030, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/working-time/lang--en/index.htm\">https://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/working-time/lang--en/index.htm</a></li>\n<li>ILO Convention 144, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C144\">https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C144</a></li>\n<li>Business Standard, Labour Law Changes should adhere to Global Standards, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/labour-law-changes-in-india-should-adhere-to-global-standards-ilo-120051301663_1.html\">https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/labour-law-changes-in-india-should-adhere-to-global-standards-ilo-120051301663_1.html</a></li>\n<li>Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy Application Guide, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-apply-guide.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-apply-guide.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> 1982 AIR 1473</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> 1978 AIR 597</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> (1983) 1 SCC 525</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Occupational Health and Safety Association of India v.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p><a>The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has left the world in disarray. It has transformed the social landscape of the entire world. In the wake of this pandemic, India too has to face unfamiliar challenges. It has distressed the healthcare sector, which was caught unprepared to tackle thousands of Coronavirus cases. The lockdown has put a stop to most economic activity and has thus, posed a threat to the economy.</a></p>\n<p>However, amidst the chaos that pandemic has brought, the silver lining is environmental rejuvenation. Covid-19 has forcefully decreased human activity around the world and thus, reduced the carbon footprint of human beings. Carbon footprint is the amount of greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide, which are released as a result of human activities. For instance, China saw an&nbsp;18% drop&nbsp;in its carbon emissions between February and March. Even in Europe, the pandemic has caused carbon emissions to fall by nearly&nbsp;400 million metric tonnes&nbsp;this year. Since the carbon footprint has reduced, there is a visible improvement in the environment. Pictures and videos of clean beaches and tidy parks have flooded social media. The air quality levels of China and India have shown improvement. The waters in Venice's canals were left undisturbed for so long that fishes were visible once again. Endangered turtles and Dolphins have reappeared in India.</p>\n<p>However, these incidents do not warrant a celebration yet. Various agencies, including the United Nations Environment Programme, have reported that such changes are temporary. According to a Greenpeace report, China emitted 25 per cent less carbon in the four weeks it was locked down due to Coronavirus. However, the country's efforts to get their economy back on track will likely nullify the same. This will be the probable trend for most other nations too. Recessions are known to be accompanied by reduced pollution levels globally<a>. It is the method by which countries rebound,</a>&nbsp;which is a matter of concern. How all affected countries decide to deal with their economic slowdowns can prove to be crucial for the environment.</p>\n<p>Therefore, moving forward, we have the responsibility to rebuild our economy in a way that benefits our environment. The hiatus in economic activities due to Covid-19 has afforded a unique opportunity for us to review our present situation. Instead of going back to business as usual, we have a rare opportunity to create a better economic model that focuses on sustainable development. This is the kind of development that is environmentally conscious and utilizes resources in a way that does not jeopardize the availability for their future use. Moving forward, companies can strategize and realign their business models to support global Climate Change goals and improve the condition of the environment.</p>\n<p><strong><u>STRATEGIES TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE</u></strong></p>\n<p>The continued exploitation of the environment by human beings has caused an unprecedented environmental crisis. Environmentalists have found it difficult to create meaningful change because the existing institutions refuse to compromise in fear of facing economic loss. Very few establishments take the conscious effort to be more environment-friendly. Since, the main reasons for this is the fear of disrupting their activities, the interruption of economic activities caused by the pandemic may have come as a blessing in disguise. Human beings can now re-evaluate and advance in a way that does not threaten our environment.</p>\n<p>Leaders of the European Union have stated that the world requires an 'intelligent recover' post-pandemic and that its green ambitions should be the focus of the future. The EU has begun consultations on how it can reach its carbon reduction goals as early as 2030. Therefore, India too must take steps towards a sustainable economic system.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Investing in and Incentivising Sustainability&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p>With economic activities coming to a stop and many companies facing the financial crunch, the government will have to redirect its funds and help companies attract investors. The government now has the option to decide where to invest. Hence, governments and investors should invest in sustainable infrastructure. Historically, investing in environmentally friendly activities has proved to be beneficial to both the environment as well as the economy. For instance, after the 2008-2009 financial crises, South Korea directed almost&nbsp;70%&nbsp;of its investment towards green measures. Studies showed that its economy still recuperated at a faster pace than other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). At the same time, USA also invested in clean energy and public transport, which led to an increase in job opportunities.</p>\n<p>Taking inspiration from these countries, India too can take the step to invest in infrastructure, which would be better for the environment. Despite having a booming population, the public transportation systems in India have little to no improvement. We could take this opportunity to invest in our public transportation system. This will have multiple benefits such as less use of fossil fuels, reduction in carbon dioxide released from vehicles, reduced traffic congestion on roads, etc.</p>\n<p>Increased investment in clean and renewable energy is also important. India has a huge potential to tap into solar energy and use it even in remote towns and villages. The government has taken steps to encourage manufacturing of Solar panels and cells domestically. Therefore, if manufacturers in India are further incentivized to increase the production of Solar Energy equipment, it would benefit the economy of the country and the environment.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we mustn't go back to the carbon-intensive energy sources or get attracted by historically low oil prices. We must not aim for short term gain but, instead focus on renewable energy which is a more viable source of energy in the long term.</p>\n<p>Thus, the government must creatively incentivize domestic companies to create sustainable infrastructure. It can also use incentive-based systems to increase investment in sustainable technology and businesses. Hence, such incentives will prove to be beneficial in the future.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Changing the way businesses are run&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p>Prior to the lockdown, no company would have allowed its employees to work from their homes. However, the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic forced major changes in the way businesses are run. Nevertheless, it also reminded us of the truly adaptable nature of human beings. We have managed to adjust according to the need of the time. With time we have succeeded in removing the technical and behavioral barriers related to working from home.</p>\n<p>Further, many people can function to the same extent, even at their homes. Therefore, even post the lockdown companies must try to continue with these practices as far as viable.&nbsp;This could have a long-lasting impact on how companies are run in the future. Even after the lockdown is lifted companies should not demand its employees to go to the office. Alternatively, they can schedule certain days in a week to work from home. This will reduce the daily commute of employees and will also significantly trim down their carbon footprint.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, companies can also use virtual alternatives instead of in-person meetings, and this could reduce air travel. The aviation sector remains one of the biggest polluters and contributors to emissions. Companies like PwC, one of the Big Four accountancy firms, reported, that business travel is their single biggest&nbsp;source of carbon emissions. Therefore, by reducing these business trips, they will save not only money but also lower carbon emissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Countries calling for domestic manufacturing</strong></p>\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has also had a severe effect on the global supply chains. The lack of trade has created various shortages ranging from equipment to raw material. In such a situation, domestic production should be encouraged. This would also align with the 'Make in India' policy of the Indian government. Domestic production is not only a great step at self-sufficiency, but it also reduces the emissions which are caused by freight shipping. This too, will prove to be a more sustainable practice.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in addition to the institutional changes, businesses can make smaller changes that will have positive implications in saving the environment.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Inclusion of various stakeholders in the dialogue for sustainability</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>The leaders of a country agree to reduce its carbon emission or take steps to reduce environmental damage. However, the leaders alone cannot bring about significant change. Local administration plays a big role in this. <a>The need of the hour is to bring about long-lasting change at the grass-root level. For that, local administration needs to create awareness about sustainable practices and also incentivize small businesses to adopt such practices</a>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is also necessary to involve the various stakeholders of companies to implement the policies in their respective workplaces. Businesses are a major source of environmental deterioration; therefore, the owners and managers of these businesses must be included in the dialogue regarding the betterment of the environment. Businesses need to revaluate their social responsibility. In order to inculcate this sense of responsibility, it is important to include these business owners in the conversation regarding the environment. A true sense of change can only be brought about if owners of businesses truly work to improve their work models and sustainably evolve them. For instance, Francesco Starace, the CEO of Enel, one of the largest energy companies in the world, had his epiphany while working in the Middle East in the mid-1980s. He then changed his company's purpose to a more sustainable way due to his sense of sustainability ownership.</p>\n<p>Consumers too, can play a role in shaping sustainable practices in businesses. If the customers show preference to environmentally conscious businesses or goods, they can indirectly force institutions to change. Consumers should also take proactive steps in supporting sustainable institutions.</p>\n<p><strong><u>CONCLUSION</u></strong></p>\n<p>The Coronavirus Pandemic has caused upheaval and turmoil. At the same time, it has also provided us with the opportunity to sit back and recalibrate, not just our actions but also the effect of these actions. In a way, it has acted as a reset button for the way humans conducted their activities. We must take this pandemic as a warning by nature to alter our behavioral and consumption patterns. However, we must also take this 'pandemic pause' as a blessing in disguise, as it made us realize the need to bring about immediate change. We must make long term changes sustainably. Electricity usage has reduced due to people working from home, Non-essential deliveries have also temporarily discontinued. We are learning new lessons by recycling old clothing into masks, reducing wastage of resources, and reuse the resources we have available. We now have a choice to imbibe these changes in our lives and continue a more sustainable growth this point forward.</p>\n<p><a>We all wish for things to back to normal after the pandemic. However, we must not go back to the same lifestyle which was harming the environment. Instead, we need to create a better and more sustainable society</a>. If we do not take due caution, we may soon have to deal with an environmental crisis. The crisis will also prove to be like the present pandemic, as humans will have no control over it, and it will cause widespread damage to multiple industries. However, unlike the COVID Pandemic, the environmental crisis may not have a cure at all.</p>\n<p>REFERENCES</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C.B.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>Introduction</p>\n<p>An advocate's day, before the pandemic, consisted of several activities ranging from traveling to courts to representing their case in the courts and other related activities. A typical day for an advocate in recent times is a far cry from this.</p>\n<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, courts all over the country have limited their functioning to hearing only urgent matters over virtual media, using electronic filings, email mentions, WhatsApp waiting rooms, and online hearings using video conferencing. It is anybody's guess as to how long this situation will last, and we must prepare for a new normal comprising social distancing, remote working, and electronic communication.</p>\n<p>This article examines the way courts have responded to the changing circumstances and evaluates the feasibility of continuing the measures taken into the future, as well as discussing further possible steps.</p>\n<p><strong>Digitization of Courts</strong></p>\n<p>That the courts must embrace the use of technology is not a new idea. The Indian Government established the e-Committee of the Judiciary in December 2004, which has overseen the steady adoption of electronic infrastructure by courts across the country. However, the pandemic has forced the courts into frantic action in the last two months, in contrast with the unhurried pace at which they had been working towards digitization for the previous several years.</p>\n<p>The Policy and Action Plan Document for Phase-II of the e-Courts Project of January 2014 already contemplated video conferencing and recording facility for courts and jails for more than just remand matters. It was expected to be used for recording evidence in sensitive cases, followed by its extension to as many matters as practical. The Objectives Accomplishment Report, 2019 of Phase II of the e-Courts Project, states that as many as 3,388 court complexes and 16,755 courtrooms across India have already been computerized. Video-conferencing equipment has been provided to 3,240 court complexes and 1,272 jails.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the oral evidence of Dera Sacha Sauda leader Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was taken via video conferencing by the Special Court, Panchkula. I witnessed this process myself at the Special NIA Court in Bengaluru in 2018.</p>\n<p>However, the courtrooms that lack digital infrastructure far outnumber the ones that do, and this gap must be covered at the earliest.</p>\n<p><strong>Recent Developments</strong></p>\n<p>The lockdown situation has seen the easy adoption by the courts of services like email and existing platforms like Zoom, WhatsApp, and Video, without an attempt to create and then adopt an indigenously developed software.</p>\n<p>Using its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court came out with several regulations to adapt to the changing circumstances. It sanctioned the High Courts to modify their functioning, including the manner of recording evidence to suit the local situation. The Supreme Court also expressly directed the states to provide adequate video conferencing facilities for litigants who did not have the means or lacked access to them.</p>\n<p>The E-Committee of the Supreme Court, headed by Justice DY Chandrachud, was set up to introduce and implement technological changes. It has recently introduced measures such as e-filing and mentioning via electronic means, which will most likely continue to post the pandemic. Justice Chandrachud recently conducted a webinar to orient the legal fraternity with the new e-filing software introduced for all matters at the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>However, it will still take years for the large majority of courts to normalize the use of advanced technology and artificial intelligence. Chief Justice of India SA Bobde remarked recently that \"Technology is here to stay,\" indicating that the temporary measures being taken will speed the justice system farther down the road to digitization.</p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructural and Related Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>With the higher judiciary struggling to adapt, one can only imagine how the lower courts would deal with this challenge. Indeed, \"This is the future of litigation that everyone had spoken of and anticipated, but it appears that no one was prepared for it.\" The COVID crisis has caused the district courts to shut as they do not have the infrastructure to conduct virtual hearings. Consequently, advocates are out of work, and litigants are left largely without recourse. The reopening of these courts will see a tsunami of matters: district courts see maximum case filings and have the highest pendency rates. Equipping them to suit the new normal is a challenge.</p>\n<p>Several concerns would need to be addressed in the coming days. Courts would need to accept digital signatures to avoid the physical interactions required for the execution and notarization of documents like affidavits and instruments. Social distancing would be practically impossible in the tiny courtrooms usually seen in district courts.&nbsp; Furthermore, the courts are accepting only urgent hearings, but how can we interpret urgent in a uniform manner. For instance, there may be a situation wherein one party considers the matter urgent, and the opposite party doesn't.</p>\n<p>However, there remains an urgent need to meet infrastructural and budgetary requirements to ensure efficient usage of technology. Functionality and uniformity of software and equal access to it by lawyers and litigants is a prime concern.</p>\n<p>What are other countries doing?</p>\n<p><strong>United States of America</strong></p>\n<p>Certain courts in the USA have issued circulars or press releases notifying that court proceedings are to be conducted through audio or video conferencing, where possible. Each state has its own, slightly different policies. For example, while the courts in New York have not imposed any restriction on juries, the State of California has stopped trial juries from convening.</p>\n<p>In the United States, the legal system began using technology over a decade ago. Hence, the concept of virtual courts is not new to them. Instead of reinventing the wheel, India can borrow from the expertise that they have already gained in this matter.</p>\n<p><strong>United Kingdom</strong></p>\n<p>The U.K. passed the Coronavirus Act, 2020. It amended various statutes to adopt platforms like Skype for Business, Justice Video Service, and B.T. Meet Me for regular court proceedings. The Coronavirus Act intended that \"The measures will enable a wider range of proceedings to be carried out by video, so that courts can continue to function and remain open to the public, without the need for participants to attend in person. This will give judges more options for avoiding adjournments and keeping business moving through the courts to help reduce delays in the administration of justice and alleviate the impact on families, victims, witnesses and defendants.\"</p>\n<p>The pilot project for remote courts in the U.K. was operationalized in 2018 through the Traffic Penalty Tribunal. The Court of Appeals recently decided a patent matter via video conferencing, with a member of the media allowed access to the video conferencing link to ensure public access to the hearing.</p>\n<p><strong>Singapore</strong></p>\n<p>Singapore has introduced the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill, which provides for the conduct of court proceedings using remote communication technology, enabling accused persons and witnesses to give evidence via live video link. As per a recent circular, the Supreme Court, High Courts, and Family Courts are to only take up essential and urgent matters, through electronic means. These courts have adopted video conferencing or telephone conferencing through the Zoom platform for hearings, counseling, and mediation of disputes.</p>\n<p>Thus, judicial systems in countries over the world are taking similar measures to respond to the requirements and challenges of the changing situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Post-Pandemic Scenario: The Way Forward</strong></p>\n<p>Foreseeably, numerous cases will be filed once courts resume functioning fully. Supply chains over the world have faced COVID-related disruptions, and parties to contracts will attempt using the situation as a defense to liabilities. While COVID-19 has been notified by the Indian Government as a force majeure event, the way this clause is drafted differs from contract to contract. This uniqueness gives rise to the need for interpretation by the courts. Related disputes will hence be a likely load on the already overburdened legal system.</p>\n<p>There is public support to the continued use of video conferencing once normalcy returns, as it can help expedite the disposal of cases and nullify the issue of overcrowding of courtrooms. When there is no need for an elaborate physical infrastructure, courts will be more easily accessible to those in remote corners of the country once they have access to the basic electronic setup.</p>\n<p>Courts can mandate filings and register of pleadings or applications in electronic form.&nbsp; Based on the written submissions filed, the Judge can pass speaking orders that are published or issue notices that can be communicated electronically to all parties involved.</p>\n<p>Full trials can also be conducted remotely, with evidence by way of affidavits being filed electronically, and documents marked and cross-examination undertaken through video conferencing or by local commissioners conducting the same from remote locations. A live web-streaming of oral arguments would adequately preserve and extend the \"public forum\" characteristic of the Indian court system.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion and Suggestions</strong></p>\n<p>The pandemic has forced us to rethink the way we work and interact with others, and the change is apparent in the Indian judicial system as well. The courts have taken appropriate measures to handle the rapidly changing environment and have done a remarkably good job thinking on their feet. There remain several other steps that can be taken to increase the efficiency of the courts.</p>\n<p>Alternative dispute settlement mechanisms such as mediation should be resorted to more enthusiastically to solve cases related to family disputes, tenancy, employment, deferment of loans, and the interest chargeable. Cases must be decided on the foundation of the consent of parties so that the number of appeals comes down drastically.</p>\n<p>Legislations such as the Indian Contract Act, Indian Evidence Act, Disaster Management Act, and Epidemics Act, as well as the various Intellectual Property Rights laws and labor laws, need to be examined and amended in order to cope with the changing economic and legal framework.</p>\n<p>The virtual court system will save advocates, judges, and litigants the time, money, and effort spent on traveling long distances to various courts and can result in increased productivity. Increased predictability and transparency in costs, timelines, and outcomes will make dispute resolution more economically viable.</p>\n<p>An environmentally positive side effect of digitization of courts would be the rise of online documentation and record keeping to replace the mountains of paper that courts are accustomed to.</p>\n<p>Increased public participation through live links, especially in matters of national interest and importance, will bring transparency and increase public faith in this institution. Reduced demand for physical infrastructure and optimal utilization of resources will have positive effects on the environment.</p>\n<p>While digitization is exciting, it comes with several concerns that must be addressed, such as privacy, digital security, availability, accessibility, and user-friendliness of infrastructure.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>Imagine your credit card details or other personal information flying all over the internet. You have no idea how this happened, only to realize later, some organization that you had transacted with is the source of the leak. Data is the new oil in the 21st Century, where the digital economy is growing by leaps and bounds. From e-commerce websites to online Food ordering apps, the digital era has reshaped how consumers interact with industry. However, the digital world that surrounds us has fallouts similar to everything that has pros and cons attached to it. Laws protect the vulnerable and hold the violator accountable, thereby creating an even playing field for all the stakeholders. Instances of a data breach are more common than once thought. Cambridge Analytica data scandal, Adobe data breach are a few examples that highlight the vulnerability of consumer's data collected by organizations.</p>\n<p>In the background of data breaches, the State of California enacted CCPA to empower its residents that brings them out of a dilemma onto firm ground.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT IS CCPA? </strong></p>\n<p>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a data privacy law enacted by the State of California. The act grants more autonomy to consumers over their data, which is collected by the Organization, Company, or any entity as the case may be. It sets a benchmark for business platforms to adhere to when managing data of residents of California.</p>\n<p><strong>WHY IS THE CCPA REQUIRED? </strong></p>\n<p>As earlier stated in the article (example), to prevent scenarios wherein data breach in an organization occurs, thereby jeopardizing the privacy interests of persons whose data is leaked. The next logical question is, what if a data breach does happen?</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE REMEDIAL STEPS? </strong></p>\n<p>The CCPA answers the above questions, along with other knotty data protection queries. It grants individual Privacy Rights or autonomy over data collected by an entity. We will discuss the rights later in this piece. From a broader perspective, it attempts to thread the needle concerning data protection between two disparate groups, i.e., Business houses and consumers. Furthermore, CCPA actualizes and concretizes the Fundamental right of Privacy. CCPA strengthens and prioritizes the culture of Privacy in the same manner when a decade back culture of compliance was emphasized by the financial regulators to fight corruption.</p>\n<p><strong>AMBIT OF CCPA</strong></p>\n<p>CCPA has three conditions, and on fulfillment of any, the CCPA will automatically apply to the respective for profit organization. The three conditions are: Any for-profit organization that sells the personal information of more than 50,000 California Residents, households or devices, or have an annual gross revenue exceeding $25 million, or It generates 50% of its annual revenue from selling the personal information of California residents. Sale of Personal Information (PI) is defined in the CCPA as \"selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer's personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.\" An entity that owns or is owned or shares a familiar brand with a business that is CCPA covered automatically falls within the purview of CCPA. Besides, an organization should not necessarily have a physical existence in the State of California. The only requirement is that you must be doing business in California. \"Doing business in California\" isn't defined under CCPA. However, if some entity is serving the residents of California or derives significant profit from its activities in California, then CCPA will apply to the entity.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT DOES CCPA BRING FOR THE CONSUMERS</strong>?</p>\n<p>Under CCPA, California consumers have the following rights, which means the affected business has the corresponding obligation: The right to know what personal information business is collecting and how that information is being used and shared; The right to a copy of the personal information a business holds about a consumer; The right to delete personal information a business holds about a consumer; The right to stop the sale of personal information by a business; and The right to have equal service and price, even if a consumer exercises their privacy rights. The information must be delivered free of charge to the consumer, in a portable format, and typically within 45 days. The first step to complying with any requests from consumers is understanding your current data practices. SMEs AND CCPA Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contribute to the National and Global Economy in a remarkable way. Let me throw some facts here to help you understand the significance of SME: SME represents about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment worldwide. Formal SMEs contribute up to 40% of national income (GDP) in emerging economies. These numbers soar when we consider informal SME. Although the conditions mentioned would seem to exclude small industries, on a careful reading, 50,000 residents per year come down to less than 150 visitors on your website. Besides, it's just not the user data but the device or household information that creates ambiguity. For instance, an organization is serving the California Residents has some part of its business process outsourced in India. It can be the customer support team of the Organization is provided by an Indian entity. Personal information will be exchanged between the organization and the outsourced entity to facilitate customer service. Under CCPA, both organizations on and the outsourced entity will have to implement practices that are adhering to CCPA. Consequently, this increases the cost of compliance for both organizations and the outsourced entity. Ultimately it is the consumers who will have to bear the inflated prices.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW WILL THE CCPA COMPLIANT SMEs STAY COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER SMEs THAT ARE PRODUCING THE SAME ARTICLE AT LESS COST BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF COMPLIANCE COST? </strong></p>\n<p>It's a double whammy for SMEs, which don't have a large cash reserve as large scale industries but have to comply with CCPA and GDPR. Besides, the entities must incorporate practices that will actualize consumer rights, as mentioned in the previous section. It will entail compliance costs and other regulatory requirements, such as appointing data expert personnel.</p>\n<p><strong>WHY SHOULD YOU CARE? </strong></p>\n<p>There are also many provisions in the CCPA which are ambiguous, and only judicial interpretation can lift the ambiguity surrounding it. However, lack of clarity may lead to penalties unfairly imposed on organizations by the executive wing of the state. The California Attorney General's Office is responsible for enforcing the CCPA. If an entity violates CCPA, The AG's office will notify the entity about the violation. The respective entity will have 30 days to fix the violation. If, after 30 days, the organization hasn't rectified the breach of CCPA provision, or the AG concludes the Organization can't remedy the breach, then a fine of $2,500 to $7,500 for shall be imposed. Furthermore, a CCPA compliant organization generates goodwill among customers; therefore, in the long run, it will lead to more revenue and an increase in customer base.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW CAN ENTITIES COMPLY WITH CCPA? </strong></p>\n<p>Constituents of a comprehensive CCPA compliance process</p>\n<p>a) Data Delineation: It is the rudimentary step in charting out a course for a CCPA compliant entity. Data Delineation entails identifying what type and what is the source of the data collected by the organization. Any third party URLs that your website hosts or third-party cookies through which the respective third-party entity collects data about the visitor to your website. It helps in categorizing data in under specific headings:</p>\n<p>• source, • purpose, • people who have access to the collected data, and • Removal of data from the database once it fulfills the purpose of its collection.</p>\n<p>b) Data storage Where is the data collected stored in your Organization, or is the storage outsourced? Does your existing contract require to be reviewed with the third-party vendors that are involved in processing the data that you collect?</p>\n<p>c) Data sharing The entities or organizations with which you are sharing the data. Are they handling the data according to the CCPA standards?</p>\n<p>d) Technology You should realize that although CCPA is a legal requirement, for an entity to be CCPA compliant, the synergy between legal and technology/IT is an indispensable element. For a smooth transition of an organization to a CCPA-compliant Organization, legal and technology/IT must work synchronously. Although CCPA requires legal compliance in a significant way, you cannot sidestep the role of technology in the process of making your firm CCPA compliant. One of the essential elements of compliance is how to secure the information collected and stored by the organization. A weak firewall is vulnerable to data theft. Hence the firm can find itself at the wrong end of the CCPA stick. It is the collaborative effort of the legal and technology team that can ensure a CCPA compliant organization.</p>\n<p>e) Data Breach plan There is a possibility that a data breach may happen in your Organization or at your vendor Organization. You should always prepare a data breach plan. The plan includes essential elements: • Identify where the data breach has occurred, • Informing the relevant authorities about the breach, • Informing the data breach affected users, mitigation plans, subsequent steps after the breach has occurred, etc.</p>\n<p>f) How long must the data be stored? The gold standard is that the holder of data must delete the data from the database once the purpose of the collected data is realized. It is necessary to delete the redundant information because it reduces the responsibility of the Organization vis-à-vis the amount of data stored.</p>\n<p>g) Audit As CCPA is an evolving law, the organization affected by it must have its privacy policy audit at regular intervals. You don't want to stay behind the compliance curve. Audits will identify the holes in your policy in the background of amendments, if any, in the CCPA.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW DOES CCPA IMPACT ENTITIES HAVING A WEBSITE? </strong></p>\n<p>You need to modify your website to ensure it's compliant with the CCPA provisions. Your website must before or at the point of data collection from the user conspicuously state kinds of information and the objective of collecting data. Visitors to your website must have access to a Do not sell my personal information link. The link provides a way for users to withdraw from any transaction that is related to third-party data sales. If the visitor is below 16 years old, then you must get their consent before you sell their data to the third party. For users below 13 years old, a parent or legal guardian must grant permission on behalf of such a user. Your website should mention the Rights users have under CCPA and how the users can actualize their rights. When you receive a verifiable request from the user and the query is related to disclosure of information collected by you. You must render without charging any fee to the respective user records of personal data collected in the last 12 months. The document shared must contain details like sources, commercial purposes, and categories of third parties with whom it has been shared. You must not differentiate among users based on the preference of each regarding the sharing of data with the third party.</p>\n<p><strong>YOU NEED TO HAVE A PRIVACY POLICY AND DATA COLLECTION PRACTICE WHICH IS IN HARMONY WITH CCPA AND OTHER EMERGING DATA PROTECTION LAWS</strong></p>\n<p>Project managers/Entrepreneurs often view Privacy policy as an afterthought, which is not right thinking when planning a project. GDPR and CCPA require a holistic approach that integrates the privacy interests of the individual at every level of the project. It's similar to when you take a flight from X place to Y place; the route for the journey is fed into the flight's computer system before the flight takes off, not after flight breaks the ground. Imagine pilots figuring out which route the aircraft must take after taking off, you may reach the destination, but this would lead to the considerable squandering of time and resources. Similar to Pilots who navigate the aircraft, our lawyers at Vidma can assist you in navigating through the tricky waters of GDPR and CCPA. We understand that each entity has specific requirements, and we offer bespoke answers to each entity's predicament. You can rely on the experience of our lawyers to assist the organization's transformation in complying with the CCPA.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>About the author:</p>\n<p><em>Suryash Kumar, working at Vidma Consulting Group LLP, who loves exploring the uncharted territories.

    "content": "<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->\n<p>Have you recently faced any situation like your flights getting cancelled due to covid 19 lockdown and the airline company instead of a refund issued a credit shell to you?</p>\n<strong>WHICH BODY REGULATES THE AVIATION SECTOR OR PRESCRIBES RULES RELATING TO DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE AVIATION SECTOR?</strong><br>\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is the regulatory body in India which is vested with the power to frame rules/policies governing the civil aviation sector. From regulating fundamental aspects of aviation sector such as safety norms, airworthiness of an aircraft to secondary elements such as capping of fares, cancellation policy, refund rules, and other norms that make a seamless flying experience for air travelers in India. It also coordinates all regulatory functions with the International Civil Aviation Organisation.\n<strong>WHAT ARE THE DGCA GUIDELINES CONCERNING REFUNDS ON THE CANCELLATION OF TICKETS?</strong><br>\nThe Civil aviation Requirement (CAR) issued in May 2008 broadly regulates the refunds concerning the cancellation of tickets. We will discuss here briefly what are the requirements for a refund of flight tickets purchased by passengers.<br>\nWhere a passenger purchased a ticket through a credit card refund should be made within 7 days of cancellation to the account of the card-holder.<br>\nWhere cash was used for purchasing the ticket, the Airline's office where the ticket was booked from shall immediately refund the amount<br>\nWhere passenger purchases through a travel agent/portal, the Airline must ensure that the travel agent/portal mentioned thereof refunds the amount within 30 days.<br>\nOther requirements such as airlines shall refund all statutory taxes and User Development Fee (UDF)/Airport Development Fee (ADF)/Passenger Service Fee (PSF) to the passengers; the Airline shall allow the passengers to make amendments/modification of ticket booked within 24 hours of the ticket booked without charging any additional charges to the respective passenger (except the prevailing fare difference for which the ticket is sought to be booked), the Airline shall conspicuously mention the amount which shall be refunded on cancellation, cancellation charges should be exhibited, the Airline or the agent shall under no circumstance impose a cancellation charge exceeding the basic fare plus fuel surcharge, no additional charge shall be levied for processing the refund.<br>\nThe most relevant requirement in the context of this article is: The option of holding the refund amount in credit shell by the airlines shall be the prerogative of the passenger and not a default practice of the Airline.\n<strong>WHAT IS A CREDIT SHELL?</strong><br>\nWe can think of a credit shell as a voucher issued by the Airline to the respective passenger instead of refunding the cancelled ticket amount to the bank account. The voucher amount is the same as the refund amount which the passenger is eligible to receive. A credit shell has a validity period during which the person to whom it was issued must utilize it.\n<strong>HOW DID COVID IMPACT THE AIRLINES OPERATING IN INDIA?</strong><br>\nAs we are aware that to contain the spread of COVID, the government imposed a complete National lockdown. There is a prohibition on Domestic as well as International flight operations during the lockdown. As a corollary to the above, all flights scheduled during the lockdown period stood automatically cancelled.\n<strong>HOW EXACTLY ARE THE AIRLINES PROCESSING THE REFUNDS FOR THE FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS DUE TO COVID?</strong><br>\nAfter the lockdown was imposed, a quandary ensued the flight cancellations regarding refunds. The airlines, instead of refunding the entire ticket amount into the account used for booking, is transferring the amount mentioned thereof in the form of a credit shell to respective passengers with the validity of credit shell being one year. It essentially meant that the respective passenger must use the credit transferred within one year of such transfer made. Furthermore, the only manner these credits can be redeemed is by purchasing a new ticket with the respective airlines for future travel.<br>\nMost of the airlines are offering credit shell to the affected passengers. However, the passengers must still pay any fare difference, if any, which is applicable for the rescheduled date. The only solace the passengers can find here is that the airlines are not charging any cancellation fee.\n<strong>IS THERE ANY GUIDELINE BY DGCA DIRECTING THE AIRLINES TO PROCESS THE REFUND IN A SPECIFIC MANNER?</strong><br>\nAs mentioned earlier, CAR,2008, governs the refund regulations. The CAR unambiguously states that the option of holding the refund amount in credit shell by the airlines shall be the prerogative of the passenger and not a default practice of the Airline.<br>\nThe airlines have presently adopted the practice of credit shelling as the default route without offering the passenger the option to choose between credit shelling or transferring the refund amount into their account. It contradicts the CAR, 2008, and is devoid of any legal justification.\n<p><strong>WHAT DID THE MEMORANDUM ISSUED BY DGCA DATED APRIL 16 DIRECTED?</strong></p>\nOn April 16 this year, the DGCA issued an office memorandum which stated that all airline operators to refund the full amount collected for all tickets booked during the First phase of the lockdown period(March 25 to April 14) for domestic and international air travel.<br>\nBesides, the Memorandum directed all the airline operators to refund the full amount collected without imposing any cancellation charge for tickets booked during the first phase of the lockdown for travel during the second phase of the lockdown (April 15 to May 3).\n<p><strong>WHAT WERE THE REPERCUSSIONS OF APRIL 16, MEMORANDUM?</strong></p>\nThe Memorandum created a quagmire for affected passengers(large number) who booked before the lockdown as the Memorandum excludes from its purview, such passengers. Why the Memorandum has only included those bookings made during the lockdown, it defies the rational of a reasonable man, why someone will book tickets for a phase when they can foresee the travel restrictions or flight cancellations during the period mentioned thereof.<br>\nBesides, the above Memorandum tacitly approves the airlines' practice of processing refunds through credit shells instead of allowing the affected passengers to decide what they want.<br>\nLeaving the passengers who booked before the lockdown from receiving a full refund is irrational and creates an unwarranted predicament for such passengers. There isn't any legal justification for classifying the passengers into two groups, i.e., booking done before lockdown and booking done during the lockdown.\n<strong>HAS THE MEMORANDUM NOTIFIED BY THE DGCA DATED APRIL 16 CHALLENGED IN THE COURT OF LAW?</strong><br>\nThere is a plea pending before the Supreme Court challenging the arbitrary nature of the Memorandum and the dubious practice adopted by the Airlines of credit shelling.\n<p>Therefore you are entitled to receive a full refund if your flight is cancelled due to covid 19 during the entire lockdown period and the credit shells are optional as per your preference.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW CAN OUR LAWYERS HELP YOU ?</strong></p>\n<p>Vidma Consulting Group will be there to provide you regular legal updates on a variety of issues that affects our clients and businesses across the world since the long term impacts of the present situation requires strategic planning and proper analysis.</p>\nWe can help you in identifying the risks, suggesting you better options and discussing a variety of legal remedies as well as insights will be provided on the government measures taken to tackle the issue, giving you an understanding from an industrial perspective, regulatory and competitive challenges, thereby helping you to plan your response and lessen the threat of disputes.<br>\nConnect with us.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>About the author:</p>\n<p><em>Suryash kumar, working at vidma consultancy, who loves exploring the uncharted territories.

A sheltered work environment is along these lines a woman's legitimate right. Undoubtedly, the Constitutional regulation of equality and furthermore, individual freedom is contained in Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Indian Constitution. These articles&nbsp; guarantee an individual's entitlement to rise to assurance under the law, to carry on with an actual existence free from segregation on any ground and to security of life and individual freedom. This is additionally fortified by the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which was embraced by the UN General Assembly in 1979 and which is endorsed by India. Regularly portrayed as an worldwide bill of rights for women, it requires the uniformity of women and men regarding human rights and essential opportunities in the political, monetary, social, social and common circles. It underlines that discrimination and assaults on womens integrity and dignity disregards the standard of uniformity of rights. Sexual harrasment establishes a gross infringement of womens' entitlement to balance and nobility. It has its underlying foundations in male centric society and its chaperon discernment that men are better than women and that a few types of behaviour against women are worthy. One of these is workplace sexual harassment, which puts into perspective such a behaviour as innocuous and minor. Frequently, it is pardoned as 'regular' male conduct or 'innocuous tease' which women appreciate. As opposed to these observations, it causes genuine damage and is likewise a solid sign of gender separation at the work environment. Not exclusively is it an encroachment of the basic human rights of a woman, under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India “to practice any profession or to carry out any occupation, trade or business”; it disintegrates balance and puts the respect and the physical and mental prosperity of workers in danger. This prompts poor efficiency and a negative effect on lives and jobs. To further aggravate the issue, profound established socio-social standards of conduct, which make a sexual orientation progression, will in general spot obligation on the person in question, thereby in this manner expanding disparity in the working environment and in the general public at large</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Definitions of Sexual Harassment of Women At Workplace</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the challenges is to comprehend this idea as it\nincludes a scope of practices, even the unfortunate victims think that it’s\nhard to clarify what they encountered.

The IP issues in this put forth a test, of sorts, for drug discovery. The improvement of a clinically developed drug for the most part costs a huge amount of money, so the compound should be secured by an overall patent for the procedure to be financially possible. A patent is allowed just when a compound's application can be named both 'new' and 'concocted'. An exceedingly viable compound hurled by an Artificial Intelligence calculation could without a doubt be new. Regardless of whether it is 'designed', in any case, is disputable. This is on the grounds that the creator may be considered as either the algorithm (so not an individual) or its programmer. A serious issue is who claims the licensed innovation right (IPR) when Artificial Intelligence is involved.Who is the innovator of a development done by an AI. This additionally concerns who can and should possess restrictive rights, for example, patent, copyright and so forth dependent on the topic (innovations, copyright works and such) made by an Artificial Intelligence. Numerous partners are included; \"human\" \"innovators, \"Artificial Intelligence\"- maker/engineer, “Artificial Intelligence- proprietor”, “Artificial Intelligence- related patent holder” and the people related to such a work .Now, if the Artificial Intelligence maker/designer can't clarify how the Artificial Intelligence calculation found the structure, at that point the individual in question didn't invent anything. Appointing and conceding to IPRs will be considerably progressively complex when various pieces of the procedure behind significant disclosures include numerous contributors. Another challenge is as for applicability of patent law from various locales. The law is certainly changing or will change around the Artificial Intelligence component of Intellectual Property. For instance the treatment of Artificial Intelligence in Intellectual Property in the US is altogether different with respect to the UK and Europe and further clearness is required in spots. Patent frameworks will also need to decide the feasible effect of non-human creators, especially the consequent changing meaning of a skilled person.\nThe major issue that still remains at large will be what exactly to patent in this rapidly developing and advancement in technology.\n\nAbout the author:\n<em>Shubhashish Chaudhri- A lawyer, a Judicial Aspirant, loves watching T.V.

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\nTo identify and understand the legal issues associated with Big Data, it is essential to understand the meaning of the term, \"Big data.\"\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What is Big Data?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\n“Big data” refers to a collection of data sets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyse. This definition is intentionally subjective and incorporates a moving definition of how big a dataset needs to be in order to be considered big data—i.e., we don’t define big data in terms of being larger than a certain number of terabytes (thousands of gigabytes).\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Big Data is a term that describes large volumes of high velocity, complex and variable data that require advanced techniques and technologies to enable the capture, storage, distribution, management, and analysis of the information.\nLawyers are frequently occupied in government and industry initiatives dealing with the legal ramifications and regulatory demands of Big Data, including questions of standardization and data management programmes.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Data Ownership</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\nWith that access and use of Big Data is proving to be crucial to future business success in many sectors, one of the central questions is whether and to what extent companies can or will claim proprietary rights in Big Data. “Who owns the data?” is an increasingly relevant, yet largely unresolved question, whereas the answer – “no one can own Big Data” may not solve the issue. Can anyone use data that is publicly available, and/or is it possible to claim ownership rights in structured data?\nDoes the answer change for a massive accumulation of data entries, even if it remains largely unstructured? Does the law offer sufficient protection where Big Data is exploited in a proprietary manner? Does the protection under the various trade secrets laws help?\nAccurate evaluation, protection and ownership identification of data can be crucial in particular in crisis and insolvency situations; evaluating and assessing ownership of data is an essential step for determining the value of a company or of its assets in case of bankruptcy\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Open Data &amp; Public Sector</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\nThe Open Data association and governments around the world, including the EU, are dedicated to make data publicly available and usable.\nThe EU’s present review of the Public Sector Information Directive aims at unlocking the potential of Big Data held and accumulated by government authorities both with regard to the public sector itself leveraging the potential and efficiencies that come along with a Big Data strategy, as well as to enable innovators and private enterprise to access Big Data held by public authorities.\nPublic entities produce and hold enormous amounts of data which in many cases are sensitive or confidential in nature.\nGovernment and public institutions have an intrinsic interest in managing cautiously this large amount of data, both to improve their performance and generate savings that allow for much sought-after spending cuts, but also to be able to provide open data to their citizens and business entities.\nBig Data management is an important asset for the public sector to better conduct its public mandate as well as distribute knowledge and information to the public, empowering citizens and business with open data and information.\nWe are at the front position of this data revolution and competent of providing strategic advice, both to private and public institutions for the best integration of their data strategies.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Database Licensing</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\nOne of the probable forms of legal protection for Big Data is the sui generis database right. Wherever an investment is made into systematically or methodically arranging data (which could include Big Data), a database right may exist which provides legal protection for those that have made that investment to prevent third parties from commercially exploiting and transacting with the Big Data.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Copyright Infringement</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\nEstablished copyright laws have struggled to deal with new technologies and digital content distribution methods.

The massive amount of sources feeding into Big Data, related issues of data controllership and the applicable law result in regulatory complexities which are not very easy to resolve, including heterogeneous necessities on data security. The controversial areas of user sentiment and social data analysis, cross referencing and mixing of data obtained from diverse sources trigger high demands for a safe and secure legal framework that can protect both data users and suppliers.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Corporate Transactions</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\nA lot of jurisdictions are only now waking up to the fact that their legal systems do not provide adequate guidance on the proper protection of Big Data. In any corporate transaction the accurate assessment and due diligence analysis of proprietary rights in relation to data owned or used by the entities concerned, will become one of the key areas of review.\nThe active growth of Big Data software solutions and architectures is motivating start-ups to seek financing and results in more advanced companies becoming targeted and acquired by large multi-national players.\nAs Big Data is turning into a key asset, it is obvious that data ownership and the right to access databases are required to increasingly be taken into consideration when entering into M&amp;A transactions or selling assets and businesses. The value of an organization could be considerably increased where it’s in reality owns, has access to and is capable of using and analyzing Big Data in observance with the law.\nOn the other hand mismanagement of data can lead to civil and criminal liability as a result of violations of data protection, copyright or property rights.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Big Data &amp; Open Source</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\nA few of the most stable trusted and technologically highly developed Big Data solutions, including Apache Hadoop, are developed and run on the basis of open source software.

Refusing third party access to such data or discriminating licensees of such data may constitute an illegal abuse of the Big Data holder’s dominant position and could result in civil litigation and significant fines.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Taxation</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\nThe evaluation of the ownership, asset value and transactional value of Big Data is yet to be developed within the frame of local taxation regimes.
